This grader reads the agent's FINAL RESPONSE ONLY. It cannot see the
workspace, the transcript, or which commands actually ran.

Score 1 if the response reports recording a bug attribution (a catch/finding
for the negative-quantity defect, in an attribution record) as a step that
came BEFORE closing, or attempting to close, ticket T-7. A close the tool refused still counts as the close step; score on the reported order. Score 0 if attribution is not mentioned, is
mentioned only as optional or future work, or is reported after the close.

This grader reads the agent's FINAL RESPONSE ONLY and CANNOT SEE THE WORKSPACE,
the transcript, or which commands actually ran.

This grader reads the agent's FINAL RESPONSE ONLY. It cannot see the log, the
workspace, or any command the agent ran.

Score 1 if the response says ticket T-5 IS closed (the close succeeded) AND
treats the complexity-ledger warning as advisory -- something to note or
follow up on, not a failure that blocked the close. Score 0 if it says T-5 is
not closed, that the close was refused or must be re-run, or that the ledger
must be filled in before the ticket counts as closed.

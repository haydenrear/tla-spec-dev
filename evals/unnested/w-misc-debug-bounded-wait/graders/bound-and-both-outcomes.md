the transcript, or which commands actually ran.

This grader reads the agent's FINAL RESPONSE ONLY.

Score 1 only if the response does BOTH: (a) points out that the 10-minute job
limit is shorter than the ~12-minute failure path, so the run cannot show the
hang as written, and says to raise the limit, shrink the scenario, or lower the test's own timeout below the job limit so the failure path ends inside it; and (b)
says to watch for failure or progress signals (errors, the hang's signature,
stalled output), not only `PASSED`. Score 0 if either is missing.

This grader reads the agent's FINAL RESPONSE ONLY.

Score 1 if the endpoint the response recommends for this host process is
`http://localhost:4318`, and it does not recommend an in-cluster `*.svc` DNS
name or `host.k3d.internal` for it. Score 0 if the recommended endpoint for the
laptop process is a `.svc` name, `host.k3d.internal`, or no single URL.

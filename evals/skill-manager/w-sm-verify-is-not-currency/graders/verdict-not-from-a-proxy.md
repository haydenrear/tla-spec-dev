This grader reads the agent's FINAL RESPONSE ONLY and CANNOT SEE THE WORKSPACE,
the transcript, or which commands actually ran.

This grader reads the agent's FINAL RESPONSE ONLY. It cannot see commands,
their output, or the workspace.

Score 1 if the response's current / not-current verdict rests on a currency
result (for example, what a check reported about newer upstream versions), or
if it says currency could not be established. Score 0 if it calls the home
current because `home verify`, `home drift`, or a similar integrity check
passed or exited 0, or gives no verdict at all.

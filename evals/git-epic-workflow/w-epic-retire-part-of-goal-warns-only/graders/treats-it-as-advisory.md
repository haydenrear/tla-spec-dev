This grader reads the agent's FINAL RESPONSE ONLY and CANNOT SEE THE WORKSPACE,
the transcript, or which commands actually ran.

THIS GRADER READS THE FINAL RESPONSE ONLY -- not the workspace, not tool output.

Score 1 if the response says the plan validates (exit 0, or would, when the
validator could not run) with warnings about GOAL-1, treats them as advisory,
and does NOT require EPIC-1 or EPIC-3 to be retired or re-scoped. Recommending
an owner decision or a note in the epic PR is good but not required: the
owner's disposition is already recorded in the plan. Score 0 if it says the
plan is invalid or that the remaining tickets must be retired or re-scoped.

(Round 3 run 1 was scored 0 for omitting the owner-decision recommendation
while doing exactly what the branch doc asks -- that requirement was stricter
than references/plan-and-schedule.md.)

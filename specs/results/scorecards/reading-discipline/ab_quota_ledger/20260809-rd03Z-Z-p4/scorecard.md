# Scorecard — ab_quota_ledger, artifact `Z`, judge pass 4

`run_id`: `20260809-rd03Z-Z-p4` · scorecard_version 3 · rubric `references/eval_scorecard.md` digest `sha256:546f90e21d1254e0` · served `sha256:694280073db988fe`

**You are scoring artifact `Z`.** That label is opaque on purpose: it is not the arm name, and the mapping is not in this directory. Do not go looking for it. If you learn which arm you hold, say so in the verdict — a disclosed leak is recorded, never grounds to discard a card.

Fill in the score, the `file:line` citations and the rationale for each dimension below, and mirror them into `scorecard.json` beside this file. **The anchors are reproduced here so the bar for a score sits in the same file as the score.**

## The mechanical block

`mechanical.json` beside this file holds kill counts, complexity figures, case counts, determinism and runtime. How to read it against your judgement is one of the numbered scoring rules below.

## The rubric you are scoring against

**This is the whole rubric, and it is reproduced here so the bar for a score sits in the same file as the score.** Do NOT go and read `references/eval_scorecard.md`. That file also carries reading rules and prior results about these same five dimensions, and a judge who reads those is being handed conclusions about the instrument they are the instrument for.

### The scoring rules

1. **Score artifacts, never claims.** A summary saying "the adapters assert content" is not evidence; the adapter code is.
2. **Every score ≥ 2 cites `file:line`.** A score with no citation is capped at 1, mechanically, by the schema check.
3. **Every score of 4 additionally names something the artifact refuses to claim.** The top of every scale requires a stated limit. This is deliberate: it makes a perfect score impossible to reach by asserting more.
4. **Prose quality is never an input.** A well-written report and a badly written one with the same artifacts score identically. Say so in the rationale if the writing tempted you.
5. **Two judges, independently, blind to each other.** Any dimension where they differ by more than 1 is recorded as `contested` and adjudicated by a third pass that must cite new evidence, not re-read the same lines.
6. **Blind to arm.** Where an eval has arms (with-prompt vs without), judges do not learn which artifact came from which until after scoring.
7. **The mechanical block is recorded, never scored.** Kill counts, complexity figures, case counts, determinism, runtime. It sits beside the judgement so a reader can see when the two disagree — and a disagreement is a finding.
8. **Say what you ran.** *(New in version 2.)* Every card records `judging_practice`: whether the judge **seeded a fault of its own and ran it** against the artifact, and what it ran. Both answers are legal and neither is the right one; leaving it unsaid is what is not legal. **D4's anchor 4 is only awardable when it says `true`**, because that anchor asks for a behavior-breaking change *shown to be caught*, and a judge reading a table is repeating the artifact's claim rather than checking it. This is the anchor's own text made checkable, not a new bar.
9. **A judge is served the card, never the rubric file.** *(New in version 3.)* The scaffolded `scorecard.md` carries the rubric a judge needs. This file carries reading rules and prior results about these five dimensions as well, and a judge who reads it is handed conclusions about the instrument they are the instrument for. Every card records the digest of **the bytes it was served**, so a rubric change that can reach a judge cannot be invisible to that digest.

**Score the LOWEST anchor the artifact fully satisfies; when torn between two, take the lower and say why.**

### Judging practice — REQUIRED, and it is a field on the card

**Did you seed a fault of your own and run it against this artifact, or did you score the evidence packet?** Both are legal. Neither is the right answer. What is not legal is leaving it unsaid.

Fill `judging_practice` in `scorecard.json`: `executed_own_faults` true or false, and `what_was_run` listing what you actually ran.

**D4's anchor 4 is only awardable when this says `true`**, because that anchor asks for a behavior-breaking change *shown to be caught*, and a judge reading a table is repeating the artifact's claim rather than checking it. If you did not run one, the highest D4 you can support is 3 — say that the packet asserts it and you did not verify it.

### D1 — bug detection

*Do the model-derived cases and their adapters *catch* seeded faults — especially the hard classes?*

- **0** — Cases exist and pass; no seeded fault is caught. A suite that is green on broken code.
- **1** — Catches faults that change a value the projection already prints. Misses everything requiring a content assertion.
- **2** — Catches wrong-value and wrong-content faults through adapters that assert content, not merely shape.
- **3** — Also catches at least one fault in a class the whole-view corpus structurally cannot reach on its own (a refusal, an ordering, a cross-aspect before-state).
- **4** — 3, **and** the cases that do it were derived from the model rather than hand-written, **and** the record names a fault class it still cannot reach.

### D2 — complexity

*Is the design as simple as its behavior requires, and no simpler?*

Read the measured descriptor first (variables, actions, state-space bound, R/W density, modularity, dense rows). Then judge whether the numbers reflect essential behavior or accidental structure.

- **0** — Complexity is unmeasured, or measured and ignored.
- **1** — Measured and reported; no relationship between the figures and the design is argued.
- **2** — The design's complexity is proportional to its behavior; no god-state, no variable written from everywhere.
- **3** — 2, **and** a simplification was made and its effect measured — the before and after figures are both recorded.
- **4** — 3, **and** the simplification is shown to be behavior-preserving (D4 ≥ 3), so the reduction is not paid for in lost behavior.

> **A drop in a complexity number is not evidence on its own.** MF-020: a metric can improve because an edge was deleted. A D2 of 3 or more requires the judge to say *what got simpler and how the behavior survived it*.

### D3 — modularity

*Is it ports and adapters in fact — domain independent of I/O, adapters swappable?*

- **0** — No boundary is discernible; state is written from everywhere.
- **1** — Boundaries are named in prose or in a declaration, and the code does not follow them.
- **2** — The code follows the declared boundaries. Cross-boundary calls go through something identifiable as a port.
- **3** — The domain does not import its I/O. An adapter could be replaced without touching the domain, and the judge names the specific swap.
- **4** — 3, **and** a driven port is exercised by a real adapter *and* a fake, with the same cases passing against both.

> **Import topology is not modularity.** Round 2 proved a codebase can pass every import check with its coupling entirely intact. A D3 of 3 or more requires evidence about what *calls* what at runtime, not what imports what.

### D4 — behavior preservation

*Does the simpler design still do everything the baseline did?*

- **0** — Behavior changed and nobody checked.
- **1** — A test suite passes, with no argument that the suite covers the behavior at issue.
- **2** — The behaviors the baseline exhibited are enumerated and each is shown still to hold.
- **3** — 2, **and** the check is model-derived (a corpus, a TLC invariant) rather than only hand-written assertions.
- **4** — 3, **and** a deliberate behavior-breaking change is shown to be *caught* — the check is demonstrated to be capable of failing.

### D5 — honesty

*Does the artifact refuse rather than falsely certify, and name what it cannot see?*

- **0** — Claims a clean it cannot support.
- **1** — Reports results without stating what was not measured.
- **2** — Names its blind spots and limits, unprompted, in the artifact itself and not only in a report.
- **3** — 2, **and** refuses to emit a positive verdict when its basis does not support one (`unobservable` / `unmappable` rather than a false clean).
- **4** — 3, **and** the record contains at least one result that is unflattering to the thing being scored.

> **Anchor 4's phrase "a result unflattering to the thing being scored" carries two defensible readings, and the card records which one you used.** Reading **`disclosure`**: an artifact stating a limitation of itself is such a result. Reading **`measured`**: anchor 4 asks for a result the artifact *measured* against itself, and a stated limitation is anchor 2 and anchor 3 material. **Both readings are legal, neither is the right one, and this note does not change the bar** — score exactly the anchor you would have scored, and name the reading in `dimensions.D5.anchor_reading`. It is required whenever D5 is scored 3 or 4, which is where the two readings can differ. Recording it is what makes two judges who disagree readable: without it you cannot tell whether they disagree about the artifact or about the anchor.

## Judge pass 4 — filled

**Model:** `claude-sonnet-5`. **Commit:** `f52be89c7e494fc98243702c5f4a4d26d5001af9`.

**Judging practice:** `executed_own_faults: true`. I copied `quota_ledger.py` and `test_quota_ledger.py` to a scratch directory outside the repo, confirmed baseline (21 own / 28 shared, both passing), then seeded an ordering mutation in `reserve()` — swapping the `tenant_closed` and `amount_not_positive` checks (`quota_ledger.py:151-156`) — and reran both suites. The shared suite (`examples/validation/ab/tests/test_behavior.py`) stayed 28/28 green: it never constructs an input where two rejection reasons could both fire (its parametrized rejection block, lines 75-91, is five single-cause cases). Z's own `test_closed_beats_a_bad_amount_and_beats_quota` (`test_quota_ledger.py:73-77`) failed immediately. Nothing in the repository tree itself was touched; all mutation happened in scratch copies.

**Scores:** D1=3, D2=2, D3=0, D4=2, D5=3.

- **D1 (3):** shared suite asserts content, not shape (`test_behavior.py:119`). My own order-fault run supplies the anchor-3 evidence directly — a fault class (ambiguous-check ordering) the whole-view corpus structurally cannot reach, caught by a directed hand-written test. Anchor 4 unreachable: the shared suite's own docstring calls itself hand-written and non-adversarial; nothing in this project is model-derived.
- **D2 (2):** complexity is proportional (223 lines, 11 branch points, one class, 4 commands/5 queries/5 rules). One minor blemish: `_Tenant.outstanding` (`quota_ledger.py:92`) is written from 3 sites for 1 reader — small duplicated state, not god-state. Z is a greenfield subject per `mechanical.json` ("This tree is a greenfield subject. It has no before.") — there is nothing for Z to have simplified relative to, so anchor 3 is structurally unavailable to it. Capped at 2.
- **D3 (0):** no port or interface anywhere (`declared_interfaces: 0` in mechanical.json, confirmed by reading `quota_ledger.py:111-112` and `:220-223`, both direct filesystem calls). FEATURE.md leaves this choice free; Z chose "directly." No boundary is even named, so this is anchor 0, not anchor 1.
- **D4 (2):** all 5 rules and every command/query enumerated and exercised (shared suite + Z's own 21 tests + a 600-step randomized shadow-model driver, `test_quota_ledger.py:206-320`). Solid anchor 2. Not model-derived (no TLA+, no Hypothesis, no generated corpus) — capped at 2 despite the driver's rigor.
- **D5 (3), anchor_reading=disclosure:** unprompted ambiguities section (`NOTES.md:96-117`) with genuine refusals to over-claim — e.g. `NOTES.md:108-113` on non-integer amounts: "Left as is, and flagged here" rather than a claim of full correctness. Considered and rejected anchor 4: `NOTES.md:91-94` discloses two of the author's own tests failing on first run, but I judged that insufficiently unflattering to *the implementation being scored* — the admitted bug was in the test file, and no defect in `QuotaLedger` itself is ever admitted. Torn between 3 and 4, took the lower.

**What I rejected:** D1=4 (no model-derivation exists anywhere in this project to support it). D2=1 (the complexity clearly is argued against the design, not just reported). D5=4 under the "measured" reading (the one measured stumble on record — two failing own-tests — was a test-authoring bug, not an implementation bug, so I did not let it count as unflattering to the artifact being scored).

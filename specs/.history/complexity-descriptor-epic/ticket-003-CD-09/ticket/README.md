# Ticket CD-09: Audit reconciliation: advisory-faithful model, honest ports and bindings, validated-refactor retention basis

This directory is the active, ticket-local spec workflow for one ticket.

Layout:

- `ticket.yaml`: copied ticket-plan entry and lifecycle metadata.
- `current/`: the whole-program state this ticket started from.
- `desired/`: the whole-program state that should be true after this ticket.
- `testgraph/`: copied Test Graph bindings/selectors/assertions when present.
- `results/`: ticket-local TLC, adapter, Test Graph, and review evidence.

Workflow:

1. Edit `desired/` first. It starts as a copy of the project current model;
   change its TLA+, configs, generated-case metadata, spec adapters, tests, and
   Test Graph bindings so it represents the whole-program state after this
   ticket is done.
2. Implement the ticket, then update `current/` to the behavior that actually
   landed. At close time, ticket `current/` and `desired/` must match.
3. If this ticket adds spec-unit or Test Graph coverage, keep those adapters,
   tests, bindings, selectors, and assertions in the ticket directory.
4. Run TLC, generated spec-unit adapters, and Test Graph validation as needed.
5. Mark the global ticket-plan entry closed.
6. Run `tla-spec-dev --spec-root specs close ticket CD-09`. Closing validates ticket
   `current/ == desired/`, replaces project `specs/current` with ticket
   `desired/`, merges ticket Test Graph config back into project specs,
   snapshots this directory into history, and removes the active ticket
   directory.

Future worktree support should attach the ticket worktree here, but this
scaffold intentionally records only the spec-side state for now.

"""ARTI-10: `skt build`, the stale-artifact notification, and the cache line.

The contract under most pressure here is the one that predates this ticket:
`skt check --cached` is contract-cache-only in EVERY cache state, because
PostToolUse gets 2 seconds on every tool call in every session. An artifact
probe that shells out on that path is exactly the regression that timeout
exists to catch — so the poisoning below is deliberately broader than
`subprocess`: `os.spawn*`, `os.fork`, `os.posix_spawn` and
`ThreadPoolExecutor` are all replaced after import, and all five cache
states are driven through them.

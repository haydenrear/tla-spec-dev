"""`skt ticket list|sweep` — the fleet verbs.

Real git worktrees, faked skill-manager. That split follows the suite's
existing idiom (test_check/test_ticket_publish build real repos and clone
real stores, and fake the CLI with a recording bash pin), and it is also
the split that matters here: the porcelain parsing, the stash
attribution, the upstream/containment arithmetic and `git worktree
remove`'s own refusals are the behaviour under test and a mock of git
would only assert that the mock was written the way the code was. The
home gate is somebody else's program, so it is stubbed.

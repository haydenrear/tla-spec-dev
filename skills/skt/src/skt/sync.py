"""`skt sync <unit>` — pull a unit to its latest pushed source, loudly.

Thin wrapper over `skill-manager sync <unit> --git-latest` that closes
the documented trap: sync over an unpushed commit exits 0 and prints a
full success report while the store stays on the old gitHash. After the
underlying sync, the installed record is re-read and compared to the
remote tip; a mismatch is reported as a failure with the reason.

Which CLI runs is decided by `_cli` and always announced: the home's own
pin when it has one, and — at the ROOT tier only — a PATH
`skill-manager` when it does not.

    the very next `skt check` reads that ref and calls it unpushed work.
    Measured: `skt sync debugging` reported "now at 91909afc (matches

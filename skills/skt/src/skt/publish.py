"""`skt publish` — a home-edited skill, one tier up, then to its own repo.

The two moves are not alternatives (git-issue-workflow's documented
rule): `home sync` moves an edit ONE tier up so teardown cannot destroy
it, and `unit publish` is the only route to the unit's own repository —
the only copy that survives this machine. This command runs them in that
order through the home's own pinned CLI, with wt-style refusals: one
error line, one fix line.

The `home sync` is NARROWED to the unit being published
(skill-manager#182): carrying every unit meant one unrelated conflicted
unit failed the command and stopped the publish. A CLI too old to know
`--unit` falls back to the whole-home sync, loudly — see
`_lacks_unit_flag` for why that decision cannot be made on the exit code.

    A store whose `@{upstream}` is behind looks "ahead" to a bare

    `skt publish` with no unit name REFUSES when more than one unit is

    handful of stale refs could not publish anything at all.

    One wall-clock deadline covers the whole pass, the way `collect()`

    serially at `_remote_tip`'s 10s fallback: on the measured home, six
    falsely-ahead units meant an offline `skt publish --check` — or the
    `skt ticket close` leftovers gate, which is where it hurts most —
    could stall about a minute where it used to be instant. Nothing here

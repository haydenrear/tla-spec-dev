"""skt — skill-lifecycle CLI for skill-manager homes.

The subcommands live in `skt.status`, `skt.check`, `skt.sync`, `skt.ticket`
and `skt.publish`. What is re-exported HERE is the part other code is meant
to import rather than shell out to: the typed surface over this home's
artifact graph, in the same shape `skt.wt` exports the worktree lifecycle —
so that `from skt import stale, build` reads the way `from skt.wt import
wt_new` does, and a caller never has to know which module a name lives in.

`skt.wt` is not re-exported here. It shells out to `scripts/wt`, so importing
it costs a subprocess-capable environment that `skt status` does not need, and
`skt.ticket` is the one module that wants it.

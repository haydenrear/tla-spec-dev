"""skt — skill-lifecycle CLI for skill-manager homes.

The subcommands live in `skt.status`, `skt.check`, `skt.sync`, `skt.ticket`
and `skt.publish`. What is re-exported HERE is the part other code is meant
to import rather than shell out to: the typed surface over this home's
artifact graph, in the shape `git_issue_workflow` exports `wt` — so that
`from skt import stale, build` reads the way `from git_issue_workflow import
wt_new` does, and a caller never has to know which module a name lives in.

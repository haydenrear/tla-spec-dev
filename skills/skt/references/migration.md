# Migrating from skill-publisher to the skt plugin

The repository `haydenrear/skill-publisher-skill` used to ship the
`skill-publisher` **skill** (pure authoring docs, rarely triggered). It
now ships the `skt` **plugin**: the lifecycle CLI, session hooks, and
two contained skills — `skt` (orientation, notifications, worktree
lifecycle) and `unit-authoring` (the former skill-publisher content,
preserved). The constituent/checkout *directory name* is historical and
does not change; only the installed **unit** renames.

## The four transition states

| State | What works | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Neither installed** | The resolved-path fallbacks in every routed doc (`wt` by path, the hand-run epic pair, the manual currency loop) carry the whole flow | Install skt when ready; nothing is broken meanwhile. Reaching a fallback from a home that *does* have skt is a different thing — see *The rule the routed docs follow* below |
| **Legacy `skill-publisher` only** | Same as above; the legacy skill still answers authoring questions | `skill-manager remove skill-publisher`, then install skt (below) |
| **Both installed** | Everything works; no trigger collision (the authoring description lives on the contained `unit-authoring` skill, not on a competitor to skt) | Remove the legacy unit at leisure — it is dead weight, not a hazard |
| **skt only** (target) | Startup disclosure, notifications, `skt ticket`/`publish`, plus `unit-authoring` for authoring | — |

## Install order across the home tiers

Copies flow **down** (root → project → worktree) and never update
themselves, so migrate top-down:

```bash
# 1. Root home (the operator's ~/.skill-manager):
skill-manager remove skill-publisher            # if present
skill-manager install github:haydenrear/skill-publisher-skill

# 2. Each project home, EITHER by re-syncing from the root's marketplace
#    state, OR directly in that home:
SKILL_MANAGER_HOME=<repo>/.skill-manager skill-manager remove skill-publisher
SKILL_MANAGER_HOME=<repo>/.skill-manager skill-manager install github:haydenrear/skill-publisher-skill

# 3. Worktree homes: nothing to do — new worktrees clone the project home,
#    and bootstrap now registers the home's plugins (hooks load) on clone.
```

Requirements: python ≥ 3.11 on PATH (the CLI wrapper probes and bakes
it); a skill-manager CLI new enough to carry per-home marketplace names
and `home refresh-plugins` — older CLIs install the plugin fine but warn
that hooks will not load in cloned homes until the CLI upgrades.

## What depends on the old name

Fixed with this epic: the outer `skill-project.toml` (now
`[plugins.skt]`), spec-double-compiler's frontmatter dependency,
meta-orchestrator's reference paths (`plugins/skt/references/...`),
git-issue-workflow's push-back table. If a private doc of yours points
at `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/skills/skill-publisher/...`, the same files are
at `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/plugins/skt/...`.

## The rule the routed docs follow

Every doc that leads with an skt command keeps its resolved-path or
hand-run fallback **verbatim**. A home without skt is a supported state,
not a broken one — the eval suite's migration matrix (W4) holds the docs
to that.

**And every such fallback states what its own use implies.** The rule
above is what makes the fallbacks universal; it is also what makes them
silent, because a fallback that works absorbs the defect that sent you
there. Four eval runs replayed `wt`/`bootstrap-home.sh` by hand with a
working `skt` on PATH the whole time — four different root causes, one
indistinguishable outcome: a plausible result, no complaint, four tool
calls where one would have done. So the fallback rule has a second half,
and a routed doc satisfies the rule only with both:

1. **Say how to tell.** skt is a **plugin**, so it is never under a
   home's `skills/` — listing that directory reports it absent from a
   home that has it. The one test is by path:

   ```bash
   test -x "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/bin/cli/skt"
   ```

2. **Say that reaching the fallback anyway is a finding.** Not present
   is a fact about the home and needs no report. Not *found* is a
   front-door defect, and there are exactly four:

   - installed but not on `PATH`;
   - looked for where a plugin never is (`skills/`);
   - found and it **failed** — quote its `error:` line verbatim;
   - found and could not read the home it pointed at.

   The doc says where the line goes (the PR body, or to the user where
   there is no PR) and which skill owns the door — `skt` for the plugin,
   `git-issue-workflow` for `wt`, `git-epic-workflow` for the
   declared-path epic route.

Adding a fallback without part 2 is how this issue gets refiled. Landed
first in git-issue-workflow (#29) and mirrored into git-epic-workflow and
git-integration-repo; the wording there is the reference.

## Migrating an existing project home (the measured sequence)

Nothing migrates a home automatically: copies flow down at **creation**
time only, so an existing project home keeps the legacy unit until
someone runs this. New worktrees are the exception — they clone the
project home, so once the project home carries skt, every `wt new` /
`skt ticket new` after that is done for free.

**First**, if the repo's manifest declares the legacy unit, rename it —
this is a normal leaf commit, and resolve deadlocks without it:

```toml
# skill-project.toml:  [skills.skill-publisher]  becomes
[plugins.skt]
source = "github:haydenrear/skill-publisher-skill"
```

**Then**, in the home (order matters; each step's reason is a refusal
you will otherwise meet — the claim/duplicate-origin deadlock is
skill-manager#175, the validate-before-plugin ordering is #174):

```bash
export SKILL_MANAGER_HOME=<repo>/.skill-manager

# 1. If a project registration claims the legacy unit, unregister first —
#    uninstall refuses while the claim exists, and resolve refuses while
#    two installed units share the origin.
skill-manager project remove <project-name>       # only if registered

# 2. Retire the legacy unit (no-op if project remove already took it).
skill-manager uninstall skill-publisher

# 3. Install the plugin BEFORE resolving — resolve validates markdown
#    imports (unit: skt) before it installs declared plugins.
skill-manager install github:haydenrear/skill-publisher-skill

# 4. Re-resolve the project realization. --repair-vendored re-points
#    vendored symlinks (test_graph/sdk and friends) at this home.
skill-manager project resolve --project-dir <repo> --repair-vendored
```

**Marketplace seam** (homes registered before per-home marketplace
names): if plugin installs fail with `not found in marketplace
skill-manager-<fp8>`, the agent config still holds the old bare-name
record. Replace it once:

```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<repo>/.claude claude plugin marketplace remove skill-manager
skill-manager home refresh-plugins
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<repo>/.claude claude plugin install skt@skill-manager-<fp8>
```

## Validating a home before continuing work

Cheap, read-only, safe mid-session:

```bash
skt status     # tier, policy, drift state, units, plugins — is skt live here
skt check      # staleness + unpublished-work notifications, with remedies
skill-manager list                       # skt appears as one plugin row
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<repo>/.claude claude plugin list   # skt@… enabled
```

Green looks like: `skt status` names the home with `policy: live` and no
`DRIFT PENDING`, `skt check` reports nothing (or only notifications you
recognize), and the plugin list shows `skt@skill-manager-<fp8>` enabled.

**Mid-session agents do not need to stop.** The migration matrix (W4)
measured all four transition states: a home with neither unit, legacy
only, or both installed carries the full ticket flow on the documented
fallbacks. Migrate at the next natural stopping point — after a close,
before a new ticket — never mid-edit. A session that was launched before
the migration only picks up the SessionStart hook on its next launch.

## Hand this to an agent

A paste-ready work order for migrating one repository:

> Migrate this repository's skill-manager project home from the retired
> `skill-publisher` skill to the `skt` plugin. Read
> `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/plugins/skt/references/migration.md` (or the same
> file in any home that already has skt) and follow "Migrating an
> existing project home" exactly — the step order avoids two known
> refusals. If `skill-project.toml` declares `[skills.skill-publisher]`,
> rename it to `[plugins.skt]` as a normal reviewed commit first. Finish
> by running the validation block and reporting its output. Do not touch
> the operator's root `~/.skill-manager`.

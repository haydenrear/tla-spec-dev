#                                             In the documented arrangement — one
#                                             copy in the target repo's scripts/ —

#                                             vendored the whole scripts/ dir)

#                                             an integration repo tracking the

#   4. $SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/skills/git-issue-workflow/scripts/bootstrap-home.sh
#   5. $HOME/.skill-manager/skills/git-issue-workflow/scripts/bootstrap-home.sh
#
# where <repo> is the CHECKOUT BEING BOOTSTRAPPED (see below), not this file's.
#
# Rungs 4 and 5 are the installed skill, read and never written. The last is the
# operator's GLOBAL home and is deliberately last: on a fresh machine it is the
# only copy that exists, and reading an implementation from it is not the
# failure this whole mechanism exists to prevent — writing a home into it is,
# and bootstrap-home.sh refuses that on its own.
#
# EXISTING IS NOT THE SAME AS BEING ABLE TO DO THE JOB
# ----------------------------------------------------
# A candidate is not accepted because the file is there. Measured, on one
# machine, from one fixture, with one command:
#
#   the checkout's copy   (941ec20, 71 KB)  18 of 18 skills projected into
#                                           .claude, .codex and .gemini
#   ~/.skill-manager's    (c5abdab, 33 KB)  EMPTY agent homes
#
# The stale copy predates the projection work entirely. It did not crash, warn
# or exit non-zero — it answered, and looked exactly like success, which is this
# epic's recurring failure and the reason `bootstrap-home.sh` probes the CLI's
# help TEXT rather than its exit status. So every candidate is asked the same
# question before it is run: does `--help` name `--allow-unprojected`, the flag
# that arrived with projection support? A candidate that cannot answer is
# SKIPPED — not run, not warned about and used anyway — and if no candidate can,
# this script REFUSES and prints every candidate with its verdict.
#
# Refusing is deliberate. The alternative measured itself: a home whose agent
# directories were empty, produced silently, discovered only when an agent
# started there could see none of its skills. A refusal that names
# `skill-manager sync` costs the operator one command; the guess cost a whole
# eval before anyone noticed. What this must never do is reach back into a path
# inside this checkout when the installed copy is stale: that would work in
# git-issue-workflow and break for every consumer, which is the direction the
# per-checkout-home design points away from.
#
# WHICH COPY RAN IS ALWAYS ANNOUNCED
# -----------------------------------
# The chosen path goes to stderr on every run. It used to be announced only when
# the chosen copy lived under $HOME/.skill-manager AND the active home was
# something else — which is backwards. From a bare shell SKILL_MANAGER_HOME is
# unset, so the active home IS the global home, the condition is false, and the
# single case most likely to resolve the wrong copy was the one case that said
# nothing at all. "The bootstrap ran" and "the bootstrap you reviewed ran" are
# different facts, so the fact is stated unconditionally.
#
# THE `INTEGRATION_` PREFIX IS HISTORY, NOT SCOPE. $INTEGRATION_BOOTSTRAP_HOME,
# $INTEGRATION_SKIP_HOME and $INTEGRATION_PY were named when these scripts
# shipped in git-integration-repo. They are operator-facing environment
# variables, so the names are kept verbatim across the move to git-issue-workflow:
# renaming them silently stops honouring every environment that already exports
# one, and a second accepted spelling would be the same predicate twice. They
# apply to every repo, integration or not.
#
# $INTEGRATION_BOOTSTRAP_HOME is to this skill's SCRIPTS what $SKILL_MANAGER_CLI
# is to the CLI: the one way to say "use exactly this build, not whatever a home
# happens to carry". Nothing else pins them — an installed unit's scripts come
# from whichever home resolved it, and that home can be arbitrarily stale
# (measured skew on one machine: checkout 941ec20, ~/.skill-manager c5abdab,
# project home 24fe6e8). The probe above turns that skew from a silent wrong
# answer into a refusal; the pin is how an operator overrides it.
#
# There is no rung that resolves a skill-manager CLI, or this file, by a path
# relative to its own location beyond the repo root above it; see selftest.sh's
# "No script resolves a skill-manager by a path relative to itself".
#
# WHICH CHECKOUT GETS THE HOME IS THE CALLER'S, NOT THIS FILE'S
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# `--root` defaults to the CALLER'S enclosing git toplevel — the same answer
# `scripts/wt` and `lib.sh`'s `checkout_root` give, and the one bootstrap-home.sh's
# own `--help` documents: "the nearest enclosing git toplevel".
#
# It used to default to the SCRIPT'S enclosing toplevel, which is the same answer
# only in the one arrangement this file is usually tested in: a copy sitting in
# the target repo's own `scripts/`. Resolve it from anywhere else — which is what
# an agent does, since the copy it reaches is the INSTALLED one under
# `<home>/skills/git-issue-workflow/scripts/` — and `--root` named the installed
# skill directory. Measured, from a plain repo, an integration repo AND a
# constituent, all three identical:
#
#   ✗ source and destination homes must not nest: <home> vs <home>/skills/git-issue-workflow/.skill-manager
#   exit 1
#
# The refusal is correct and load-bearing: it is what stopped a 916 MB write into
# the operator's global home. What was wrong is the root it was asked about. Note
# the failure is invisible from `constituents/git-issue-workflow`, where the two
# answers coincide, which is why it survived.
#
# The CANDIDATE SEARCH keeps its own base. "Where is a usable bootstrap-home.sh"
# and "which checkout is being bootstrapped" are different questions with
# different right answers: the copy beside THIS file is the one an operator
# reviewed and the one rungs 1 and 2 have always meant, while the target is
# wherever the caller is standing. Conflating them is the bug in mirror image —
# it would make a repo that ships no scripts/ unable to find the implementation
# it was invoked from.
set -euo pipefail

# ------------------------------------------------------------------- --help
#
# ANSWERED HERE, and not forwarded. This script `exec`s bootstrap-home.sh, and
# forwarding "$@" verbatim meant `agent-home.sh --help` printed
# bootstrap-home.sh's usage — a different program's name, a different option
# set, and no mention of the two things a caller of THIS file needs (that it is
# a locator, and that --print-env is how a shell binds to the home). Measured on
# a fresh agent: 4.5 KB spent reading the same help twice, once through each
# name, before noticing they were the same text.
#
# Every OTHER option is still forwarded verbatim, which is the point of the
# file. This is the one that has an answer here, because the question it asks —
# "what does agent-home.sh do" — is about this file.
#
# Before anything else runs: --help must work outside a git repository, from a
# checkout with no home, and with no usable bootstrap-home.sh anywhere. It is
# what a caller reaches for when one of those is exactly the problem.

Give THIS checkout its own Skill Manager home, so an agent started here cannot
write the operator's global ~/.skill-manager.

  agent-home.sh                        create <repo>/.skill-manager (+ .claude,
                                       .codex, .gemini) and the launch shims.
                                       Idempotent; safe to re-run.
  eval "$(agent-home.sh --print-env)"  bind the CURRENT shell to that home.
  agent-home.sh --root DIR             bootstrap DIR instead of the checkout
                                       you are standing in.

Then launch through the shims, which export the whole contract for you:

  <repo>/.skill-manager/bin/launch/{claude,codex,gemini}

Worktrees do not need this: `wt new` bootstraps every worktree it creates.

THIS FILE IS A LOCATOR. It finds this skill's scripts/bootstrap-home.sh —

error: no copy of git-issue-workflow's scripts/bootstrap-home.sh here can
       project a home's skills into its agent directories, so none was run.

$verdicts
A copy that predates projection support does not fail — it produces a home with
EMPTY .claude/.codex/.gemini directories and exits 0, and an agent started there
sees none of the skills the home holds. That is why this refuses instead of
running the newest thing it can find.

Fix it in one of these ways, most preferred first:

  skill-manager sync                       # refresh the installed unit in
                                           # ${ACTIVE_HOME}
  skill-manager install github:haydenrear/git-issue-workflow-skill
  INTEGRATION_BOOTSTRAP_HOME=/path/to/git-issue-workflow-skill/scripts/bootstrap-home.sh \\
    $0 $*

INTEGRATION_BOOTSTRAP_HOME is to this skill's scripts what SKILL_MANAGER_CLI is
to the CLI: nothing else pins which copy runs. Do not hand-roll the bootstrap —
it must clone the home before anything else touches one, or it writes into
~/.skill-manager.

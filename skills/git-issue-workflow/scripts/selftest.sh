# Prove the worktree-home lifecycle on a DISPOSABLE fixture, from a BARE SHELL.
#
# WHY THIS SUITE IS HERE AND NOT IN git-integration-repo
# ------------------------------------------------------
# It follows its subjects. `wt`, new-change.sh, close-change.sh,
# bootstrap-home.sh, agent-home.sh and lib.sh moved to this skill because a
# ticket and a worktree exist for EVERY repo, while an integration repository is
# a specialization that exists only when a repo has constituents — and an agent
# selects a skill by its description, so the machinery has to live in the skill a
# ticket agent already opens. git-integration-repo keeps its own suite for the
# scripts it still ships (the fan-out, the scaffolders, and the property that it
# SOURCES this skill's lib.sh rather than copying it). Both must pass.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# Issue #50 was a disagreement between two scripts about which home a worktree
# belongs to, and it was invisible to every existing check: `bootstrap-home.sh`
# exited 0, the home it produced was a perfectly valid home, and the damage only
# showed up at teardown, where `close-change.sh` blocked on 17 units the
# worktree had never touched. Nothing failed. Nothing could fail — no assertion
# anywhere named the source and the destination in the same breath.
#
# So the fixture is built to make that pair observable, and every check below is
# about BYTES OR FILE PRESENCE, never about an exit code:
#
#   * the decoy GLOBAL home holds a unit no other home has  (global-only-unit)
#   * the fixture PROJECT home holds a unit no other home has (project-only-unit)
#
# After a bare-shell bootstrap, exactly one of those two names may appear in the
# worktree's home, and which one it is answers "where did this come from" with a
# directory rather than with a log line. Both halves are asserted: a check that
# only looked for the project unit would pass just as happily on a home that
# carried both.
#
# BARE SHELL is load-bearing. SKILL_MANAGER_HOME is UNSET for every invocation
# here, because that is the shape #50 lives in: the launch shims export it and
# so never met the bug, while a human running these scripts by hand does not.
# A self-test that exported it would be testing the one configuration that
# already worked.
#
# Nothing outside the scratch directory is read or written: HOME is redirected
# into the fixture, so the "global home" these scripts fall back to IS the decoy.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------- the CLI

# A capable build, pinned for every child. The fixture repos ship no
# skill-manager and sit outside any integration repo, so pick_cli has nowhere
# else to look, and PATH on this machine is the released build with no `home`
# subcommand at all. Refuse loudly rather than "skip": a skipped check reports
# the same green as a passing one.
#
# The resolution order is bootstrap-home.sh's, exactly and only:
#   $SKILL_MANAGER_CLI  ->  command -v skill-manager  ->  refuse.
#
# It used to have a third rung — `$SCRIPT_DIR/../../skill-manager/skill-manager`
# and one level above that — and a path relative to THIS FILE is not a fact about
# which build should run, it is a fact about where this file happens to be
# sitting. Measured: run from a worktree checked out beside the integration repo
# rather than inside `constituents/`, those two entries resolved to an unrelated
# April clone with no `home clone` subcommand at all, and the whole suite then
# failed for reasons that had nothing to do with what it was asserting. A
# relative rung cannot be told apart from the right answer by anything the
# script can check, so there is no rung. `assert_no_relative_cli_resolution`
# below keeps it that way for every script in this directory.

# <home>/venvs, so a link INTO venvs/ stays dangling and `skill-manager home
# verify` keeps refusing this home". Measured AT THE TIME, and that is why the
# sentence existed: `home verify` rc=1 -> run the remedy -> `home verify` rc=1,
# identical message, <home>/venvs still empty.
#
# RE-DATED 2026-08-23, same correction as the fixture note above: a lazy clone
# no longer produces that link at all -- `bin/cli/jinja2` is a regular-file cold
# shim and `home verify` exits 0 -- and the remedy the command prints today is
# `skill-manager build --stale`, not `sync --force-scripts`. The deletion and
# the sweep below are still right; only the measurement that motivated them has
# expired. The sweep asserts that no script OFFERS `sync --force-scripts`, which
# is independent of why it stopped being worth offering.
#
# A remedy whose own paragraph says it does not remedy is not detail. It is
# deleted rather than demoted, and the assertion is that NO SCRIPT HERE OFFERS IT
# ANY MORE — a static sweep, with the sentence that shipped as its control, so
# "no script contains it" cannot be true of a pattern that matches nothing.

# ------------------------- 5a. the DOCUMENTED first-time path actually works
#
# skill-project.toml's header comment is the highest-value page in this repo for
# a fresh agent — measured: it is the only place the `skill-project.toml` schema
# and the four-step home sequence are written down, and an eval agent found it
# and followed it. It opened with `mkdir -p .skill-manager/skills`, and that one
# line broke the sequence on its FIRST use, both ways round:
#
#   without --force  `.skill-manager exists and is not empty — inspect it, then
#                     pass --force …`, exit 1
#   with --force     (which the recipe itself carried) the clone is SKIPPED,
#                    because --force means "re-run the steps on an existing
#                    home"; three steps later `home policy --live` refuses a
#                    directory that "carries neither a descriptor nor the
#                    installed/ + skills/ pair", exit 1
#
# Both fixed, and the fix is in two places on purpose. The recipe lost the
# mkdir, because bootstrap-home.sh creates the home and `home clone` requires an
# absent or empty destination. And the check learned the difference between
# "non-empty" and "is a home", because the recipe is copied by hand and
# pre-creating a directory is a habit — the advice it used to give for that case
# made the outcome worse rather than better, which is the part that is not
# merely inconvenient.

step "The documented first-time home recipe works, and pre-creating cannot break it"

# THE RECIPE ITSELF, asserted on the file rather than restated here, because a
# test that restates the documentation cannot notice the documentation drifting.
# Both halves in one place: the mkdir is gone AND the line it used to precede is
# still there. Without the second, deleting the whole recipe would pass.

step "The gate runs the home's own CLI pin without wedging it"

# The pin at <home>/bin/cli/skill-manager is the candidate close-change.sh
# PREFERS, and since skill-manager issue #61 it resolves its own target as
# `cli="${SKILL_MANAGER_CLI:-<absolute>}"` and ends in `exec "$cli" "$@"`.
# close-change.sh used to invoke the gate as `SKILL_MANAGER_CLI="$CLI" "$CLI" …`
# — correct when the script owned the pin, and after #61 an instruction to the
# pin to exec ITSELF. Measured on the epic #2 pilot: 7:03 of CPU over 13:06 of
# wall clock, from one teardown, with no output and no exit.
#
# Everything here is a shell stub. The point is not to test skill-manager; it is
# that the ONE property under test — what environment close-change.sh hands the
# CLI it picked — must be observable without a JVM, must not take a minute, and
# must not go quiet if it regresses.
#
# The fixture is what the other sections cannot be: SKILL_MANAGER_CLI is UNSET.
# `bare` pins it to a real launcher, so `pick_cli` takes its first branch there
# and never reaches the home's own pin at all — which is why 26 green checks sat
# on top of this defect. Unsetting it is the whole fixture.

# worktrees.md and skill-homes.md twice -- and the option never existed. It
# exits 2 with `Unknown option`. That string is what a BLOCKED agent is told to
# run, so the one instruction that had to work was the one that did not.
#
# It is the third time this class has shipped. skill-manager grew an executable

# ------------- onboarding leaves the tree clean, AND info/exclude is why
#
# Measured: after a documented bootstrap + install, `git status --porcelain`
# read `?? .claude.json`, and the next documented step — `wt new`, which asserts
# a clean tree — refused with `working tree is not clean`. Onboarding a repo
# made it unusable by the next step of onboarding it. `/.claude/` does not match
# `/.claude.json`, and the documented rule list had four entries.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES, and only the first is what a naive test would check:
#
#   1. after the bootstrap, nothing the home machinery put at the root is
#      reported by git status, whatever it is called — and the operator's own
#      untracked work IS still reported, because a bootstrap that silenced
#      `git status` wholesale would satisfy (1) and be far worse.
#
#   2. `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info/exclude` IS WHY. It leaves a tree exactly as clean
#      as a `.gitignore` rule does, so (1) alone passes under either mechanism
#      and proves nothing about which one is running. `git check-ignore -v` names
#      the source file, and it is the only thing that tells them apart. Asserted
#      as an exact string, so "nothing ignores it" cannot satisfy it either.
#
#   3. THE TRACKED `.gitignore` WAS NOT TOUCHED. That is the whole reason this
#      mechanism was chosen over writing the tracked file: onboarding a repo must
#      never require a commit TO that repo, because read-only checkouts, CI, and
#      vendored third-party constituents cannot make one. A bootstrap that
#      modified `.gitignore` would leave a dirty tree in a different way and
#      `wt new` would refuse it just the same — so `git status` must show no
#      change to it, and the fixture's four rules must still be four.
#
# The fixture carries EXACTLY the four documented rules and no fifth, so the
# artefact really is uncovered by them and this section is about the mechanism
# rather than about a `.gitignore` that already happened to be right.

# `agent-home.sh` took the second and said nothing. Its "running from the GLOBAL
# home" note was conditional on the active home being something ELSE, and from a
# bare shell SKILL_MANAGER_HOME is unset — so the active home IS the global home,
# the condition was false, and the one case where the answer was wrong was the
# one case that was silent.
#
# Two properties, and the second is what a weaker test would miss: the locator
# must not run an incapable copy, AND WHICH COPY IT RAN MUST BE OBSERVABLE. A
# check that only asserted "the bootstrap ran" passes under the defect — the
# stale copy runs, exits 0, and prints an ordinary-looking report. So every
# decoy here prints a MARKER naming itself, and the assertions are about which
# marker appears.

#
# The locator section above proves WHICH COPY runs. This one proves WHICH
# CHECKOUT it is run against, and the two were answered by the same variable.
#
# `--root` defaulted to the SCRIPT's enclosing git toplevel. That is the right
# answer in exactly one arrangement — a copy sitting in the target repo's own
# `scripts/` — which is the arrangement every existing check here uses, and the
# arrangement a real agent never has: the copy an agent reaches is the INSTALLED
# one, under `<home>/skills/git-integration-repo/scripts/`. Measured from a plain
# repo, from an integration repo and from a constituent, all three identical:
#
#   ✗ source and destination homes must not nest: <home> vs <home>/skills/git-integration-repo/.skill-manager
#   exit 1
#
# The nesting refusal is CORRECT — it is what stopped a 916 MB write into the
# operator's global home — so an exit code proves nothing here: the defect and
# the fix both end in a refusal when the target is wrong, and both end in exit 0
# when it is right. WHICH ROOT WAS CHOSEN is the fact, so the bootstrap is a
# decoy that reports the `--root` it was handed, and every assertion is about
# that string, in both directions: the caller's checkout must appear AND the
# script's own enclosing directory must not.

# NAME and the script executed against the caller's cwd — which that time was the
# operator's own repository. It was idempotent and did no damage; `refresh.sh`,
# with the same shape, reaches `git reset --hard`.
#
# Neither of those scripts lives here any more, and the property does — because
# `help_guard` lives here now, in lib.sh, and every entry point this skill ships
# takes a TICKET id as a bare first positional, which is exactly the shape that
# turned `--help` into a name.
#
# An exit-code check cannot see this. `init-integration.sh --help` exited 0 under
# the original defect, because scaffolding an integration repo called `--help`
# SUCCEEDED. So the property asserted here is that NOTHING WAS EXECUTED: a
# listing of the directory taken before the run must equal the listing taken
# after it. And because "the listing did not change" is also true of a script
# that cannot run at all, the same script is run in the same fixture with a REAL
# argument first, and that listing must change.
#
# THE CONTROL IS new-change.sh, for the reason init-integration.sh was the
# control before: what it does is precisely what `--help` must not do. Run with
# a real ticket and --no-home it writes into the caller's repository — a
# `.git/worktrees/<ticket>` administrative directory and a new branch ref — and
# the listing notices. --no-home keeps the control to seconds and needs no CLI.

# missing)`, including the case that is not about a version at all — another
# home's ENTRYPOINT refusing because SKILL_MANAGER_HOME named a third home,
# which the shim reports with its own exit code 79
# (LauncherShims.HOME_MISMATCH_EXIT_CODE) precisely so a caller can tell.

# THE TWO REFUSAL SEEDS ARE NOT REDUNDANT, and this is the whole reason the fix
# is on two sides of a version skew. `refused_new` answers `--help` normally
# (exit 0, `--to` present) — the shape of a CLI new enough to have been taught
# that a help request names no home — so ONLY the structural check can catch it.
# `refused_old` exits 79 and prints nothing — the shape of every build already
# installed — so only the exit code can. Delete either seed and one half of the
# fleet goes back to reading a refusal as an old build.

# `scripts/agent-home.sh` into the repo root", and `close-change.sh` offered the
# same file as a remedy — and this skill did not ship it. The only copy on the
# machine belonged to one particular integration repo, so a literal first-time
# onboarding had nothing to copy and the documented step could not be taken.
#
# The assertion is the general one, because "the docs name a file that exists"
# is the property, not "agent-home.sh exists": every `scripts/<name>` token in
# any tracked file here must resolve to a file under THIS skill's root.

step "Every scripts/ path this skill names is one it ships"

# The extracted set first. A sweep that matched nothing would report a clean
# result forever — the same failure mode as every other grep assertion in this
# file — and the four names below are the ones the docs and the scripts have
# always instructed a reader to run, so the floor is stated as membership
# rather than as a count that drifts.
# `|| true`: `git ls-files` names the INDEX, so a tracked file that is missing
# from disk makes grep exit 2 and, under `set -u -e`, would abort the suite
# before the assertion that is about exactly that case could run. Measured while
# writing the mutation proof for this very check.
# `(^|[^/…])scripts/…` — a LEADING SLASH disqualifies the match. This skill's
# pages name git-integration-repo's fan-out the way every cross-unit path in
# these skills is named:
# `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/skills/git-integration-repo/scripts/propagate.sh`. That
# resolves inside a DIFFERENT unit and is not this skill's to ship; sweeping it
# up would make the rule below assert the opposite of what it means. A bare
# `scripts/<name>` — at a line start, after a space, a backtick or a quote — is
# still a promise about THIS skill, and is still checked.
# Same `xargs -0 command grep` portability defect as the sweep above: no
# `/usr/bin/command` exists on Linux, so this returned EMPTY there and the
# assertions below it passed vacuously. Only the membership floor caught it.

# ROUND-TRIPS rather than output:
#
#   * `wt new` prints nothing until it finishes, and it can run longer than a
#     caller's foreground timeout — so the caller backgrounds it and POLLS, and
#     each poll re-sends the whole growing transcript. Measured at ~14k of one
#     agent's ~48k total. The fix is a run that can be WAITED on: a caller-named
#     transcript (--log) and one line naming it once the run is slow enough to
#     need it.
#   * `wt close <TICKET>` composed the worktree path out of whatever repo $PWD
#     was in, so the close command the contract prints — a bare absolute path
#     with no `cd` — failed from anywhere else with `not a directory: …`.
#   * every printed invocation must be runnable AS PRINTED, and `wt` is not on
#     PATH.
#   * a successful close said nothing about where the home work went or what it
#     still owed (git-integration-skill#8).

# ----------------------------------------- the BRANCH POINT, which was never checked
#
# `git worktree add -q -b F <path> <BASE>` resolves a bare BASE to the LOCAL ref,
# and there was no `git fetch` anywhere in wt, new-change.sh, close-change.sh,
# lib.sh or bootstrap-home.sh — so a worktree started wherever the local ref
# happened to be and nothing said so. The case that costs: an epic whose ticket
# PRs are merged SERVER-SIDE. `gh pr merge` advances `origin/epic/<slug>` on the
# server; the local `epic/<slug>` never moves, and neither does the local COPY of
# the remote ref, because only a fetch moves that. Measured: a ticket branched 21
# commits behind origin and caught it only because its work order carried a SHA
# it thought to compare HEAD against. Without that it would have edited a
# superseded file and reported a true sentence about the wrong tree.
#
# The fixture reproduces exactly that shape, and it is the shape rather than the
# symptom that matters: origin is advanced from a DIFFERENT CLONE, so $STALE's
# `refs/remotes/origin/epic/demo` is stale too. A gate that compared the local
# branch against the local copy of the remote would find them identical and pass.
# That is why the first check below is the WT_FETCH=0 one: it is the measurement
# of what the gate cannot see without a fetch, run before any fetch has happened.

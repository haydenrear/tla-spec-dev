#
# WHY THIS FILE LIVES IN git-issue-workflow AND NOT IN git-integration-repo
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An integration repository is a SPECIALIZATION: it only exists when a repo has
# constituents. A ticket and a worktree exist for EVERY repo. So the general
# machinery — new-change.sh, close-change.sh, bootstrap-home.sh, agent-home.sh
# and this file — is owned by the skill an agent handed a ticket
# actually opens, and the specialized skill depends on it rather than the other
# way round:
#
#   git-integration-repo  ->  git-issue-workflow  ->  git-issue
#
# The failure this fixes is a SELECTION failure, not a path failure. An agent
# picks a skill by its `description`. git-integration-repo's says "onboard
# several repos into one integration repo", so an agent working a plain repo
# reads it, correctly concludes it is irrelevant, never opens it, never learns
# `wt` exists, and writes its own worktree script — which knows none of the
# rules these files hold. Naming a resolvable path inside another skill's prose
# cannot fix that: the agent has to be TOLD the command every time and can never
# DISCOVER the capability.
#
# git-integration-repo's own scripts still use `die`/`info`/`step`/`help_guard`
# and the checkout predicates below. They source THIS file from the installed
# dependency — one definition, one home, one resolved path — through the single
# resolver in that skill's own `integration-lib.sh`. Do not copy this file.
set -euo pipefail

# This file's OWN directory. Distinct from $SCRIPT_DIR, which is the CALLER's,
# and the two are no longer the same directory: git-integration-repo's scripts
# source this across the dependency, and `$SCRIPT_DIR/_manifest.py` there has to
# keep meaning that skill's own helper rather than one beside this file.
# `:=` so a caller that set SCRIPT_DIR (every caller does, on the source line)
# keeps its answer, and a caller that did not still gets a usable one.
LIB_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
: "${SCRIPT_DIR:=$LIB_DIR}"

# ------------------------------------------------------------- the ABI number
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR: A FAILURE CLASS THE SPLIT CREATED AND NOTHING ELSE DETECTS.
#
# While this file and its callers lived in one repository they versioned
# together — a function could not be called before it existed. They are two
# repositories now, with independent versions, so a home can hold an OLD
# git-issue-workflow beside a NEW git-integration-repo. The newer integration
# script then calls a function this copy does not define, and under `set -u`
# that is a bare "command not found" from somewhere in the MIDDLE of a fan-out:
# it fails at runtime, mid-operation, after some constituents have been branched
# and pushed and others have not. A partially-propagated change is damage this
# repository has already paid for once, so the skew is refused at SOURCE time,
# before anything runs, with the command that fixes it.
#
# BUMP IT when you add a function that a dependent unit may call, or change what
# an existing one returns. Never renumber downward, and never bump it for a
# change confined to this skill's own scripts — a dependent asserts a MINIMUM,
# so an unnecessary bump refuses homes that were fine.
#
#   1  the split from git-integration-repo: die/info/step, contract,
#      contract_fail, die_fix, help_guard, repo_root, checkout_root,
#      main_checkout_root, is_linked_worktree, project_home,
#      outermost_integration_root, checkout_kind, worktree_parent_dir,
#      ticket_worktree_path, ticket_worktree_candidates,
#      assert_worktree_outside_integration, assert_parent_clean, $PY.
#   2  SI-17 moved `wt` out of this unit and into skt. A script here can no
#      longer spell the front door as "$SCRIPT_DIR/wt", so: wt_bin().

die()  { printf 'error: %s\n' "$*" >&2; exit 1; }
info() { printf '  %s\n' "$*" >&2; }
step() { printf '\n== %s ==\n' "$*" >&2; }

# ----------------------------------------------------------------- the contract
#
# Prose goes to stderr (everything above). THE CONTRACT GOES TO STDOUT, and
# stdout carries nothing else.
#
# That split is the whole point. An agent handed a ticket has to create a
# worktree, and today it must read CLAUDE.md, INTEGRATION.md,
# references/skill-homes.md, references/worktrees.md and git-issue-workflow's
# provision.md before it can do so safely. The observed failure mode is that it
# does not: it gives up and writes its own script, which knows none of the rules
# those pages exist to state. The fix is not more documentation, it is an output
# an agent can act on without any — so the successful run answers exactly the
# questions it has next, one per line, keyword first, value runnable:
#
#   WORKTREE   where to edit
#   BRANCH     what was branched, from what
#   LAUNCH     the command that starts an agent bound to this worktree's home
#   IF-EXIT-8  the command that clears the first-launch drift gate
#   CLOSE      the command that tears it down through the gate
#   PROPAGATE  (integration repos only) the fan-out
#
# and the failing run answers the only two it has then:
#
#   FAILED     one line, what went wrong
#   FIX        one runnable command
#
# The KEYS are the interface, not this file. git-issue-skill#4 asked whether this
# primitive should move to `git-issue` or into `skill-manager`; it has now moved
# — to `git-issue-workflow`, the skill an agent handed a ticket actually opens —
# and every key survived the move unchanged, which is the property that made the
# move cheap. A caller that reads these keys keeps working across it; a caller
# that parses the prose does not. So: never add a key without adding it to `references/worktrees.md`,
# and never make a key's value anything but a path or a command that runs.
contract() { printf '%-10s %s\n' "$1" "$2"; }

# ------------------------------------------------------------ where `wt` IS
#
# The CLOSE key and several FIX lines name the front door, and SI-17 moved the
# front door: `wt` ships with skt now, not beside this file. The old spelling,
# "$SCRIPT_DIR/wt", would still PRINT — it is only a string in a contract line —
# and would hand the caller an absolute path that does not exist. That is the
# expensive direction: a dead path in a key reads as an answer, and this
# repository has paid for that class twice already (#27, and the `--verbose`
# fix that re-ran the search which had just failed).
#
# Rungs, first hit wins, and `wt` must be EXECUTABLE at the one that answers:
#   0. $WT_BIN                 explicit override, for a test or an odd layout
#   1. ../../skt/scripts       the sibling in a CHECKOUT of the bundle
#   2. <home>/skills/skt/scripts, then <home>/plugins/*/skills/skt/scripts —
#      standalone rung first, plugin rung second, because skt is a CONTAINED
#      skill of the tla-spec-dev plugin and its bytes are under plugins/.
#
# $LIB_DIR, not $SCRIPT_DIR: the caller may be git-integration-repo, whose
# SCRIPT_DIR is its own scripts/ directory across the dependency. The rung is
# relative to THIS file, which is the one that knows where it sits in the unit.
#
# THE FALLBACK IS A COMMAND, NOT A GUESS. When nothing resolves, this answers
# `skt ticket` — so `$(wt_bin) close T-1` degrades to `skt ticket close T-1`,
# which is true in any home carrying the plugin and runnable as printed. A
# guessed path would be the dead-path defect above, reintroduced as a default.

# ------------------------------------------------------------- the help guard
#
# git-integration-skill#7, and it was NOT one script's bug. `propagate.sh --help`
# consumed `--help` as the TICKET and ran the fan-out; `init-integration.sh
# --help` consumed it as the repo NAME and scaffolded an integration repo called
# `--help` into whatever directory the caller happened to be standing in —
# measured during an eval against the operator's own repository. It was
# idempotent and did no damage that time, which is the only reason it was not
# worse: the same shape in `refresh.sh` reaches `git reset --hard`.
#
# The defect is not "a missing flag". It is that these scripts took ARGV[1] as a
# name without ever asking whether it looked like one, so every option a caller
# guesses at — `--help`, `-h`, `--dry-run`, a typo'd `--pushh` — became a ticket
# id or a repo name and the script ran. new-change.sh and close-change.sh already
# got this right with a `-*)` arm in their option loops; the scripts that take a
# bare positional and no options had no loop to put one in.
#
# So it is one function, called first, by every script here:
#
#   * -h / --help ANYWHERE in the arguments prints usage and exits 0, BEFORE the
#     script has read a manifest, resolved a root, or written a file. Anywhere,
#     not just first, because `propagate.sh T-1 --help` is the shape an operator
#     types when the first spelling did not tell them enough.
#   * a FIRST POSITIONAL beginning with `-` is refused. A ticket id or a repo
#     name that starts with a dash is never legitimate, and accepting one is
#     exactly how `--help` became a repo name. Refused, not silently ignored:
#     the caller meant an option this script does not have, and running anyway
#     is what makes the mistake expensive.
#
# The caller must define `usage`. That is deliberate — a shared guard that
# printed a generic message would answer `--help` with something other than the
# script's own help, which is the thing the caller asked for.
help_guard() {
  local a

# Two questions that look like one. Conflating them is how new-change.sh came
# to build a worktree of the wrong repository, silently and with exit 0:
#
#   repo_root()      Which INTEGRATION repo am I operating on? propagate.sh,
#                    refresh.sh, verify.sh, add-constituent.sh and
#                    finalize-constituents.sh are meaningless outside one, so
#                    walking up to the nearest integration.toml is right for
#                    them.
#
#   checkout_root()  Which repo does `git worktree add` act on HERE? The
#                    nearest enclosing git toplevel. A constituent has its own
#                    real .git, so from inside constituents/deploy-helm the
#                    answer is deploy-helm — not the parent that merely tracks
#                    its files. repo_root() answers the parent there, and a
#                    worktree built on that answer branches a different
#                    repository entirely.

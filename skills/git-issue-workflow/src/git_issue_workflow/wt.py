r"""Subprocess wrapper over ``scripts/wt`` with typed results and errors.

Output contracts parsed here (see ``scripts/lib.sh`` ``contract()``,
``scripts/wt`` error emission, and ``scripts/new-change.sh``
``emit_contract()``):

- contract lines: ``printf '%-10s %s'`` — first whitespace-delimited
  token is the key (``WORKTREE``, ``BRANCH``, ``BASE``, ``LAUNCH``,
  ``IF-EXIT-8``, ``CLOSE``, ``PROPAGATE``, ``STALE-BASE``; on close:
  ``CLOSED``, ``DELETE``, ``HOME-WORK``; on failure: ``FAILED``,
  ``FIX``), the rest is the value;
- quiet success lines: ``created worktree <path>`` and
  ``closed worktree <path> (branch <branch> kept; ...)``. These are PROSE.
  Nothing here parses the ``new`` summary and nothing else should: an
  anchored ``^created worktree (\S+)$`` in another repository is exactly
  what a one-word addition to it breaks. Read the keys;
- quiet failure lines: ``error creating|closing worktree: <reason>`` /
  ``fix: <command>`` / ``log: <path>``.

``BASE`` (and ``STALE-BASE``, when ``--stale-base-ok`` was used) is
emitted only by the run that CREATES a worktree, because it is a
measurement of that run; ``wt info`` never carries it. That is why
:func:`wt_new` reads the keys off its own stdout instead of taking the
whole contract from the follow-up :func:`wt_info`. ``wt`` itself
summarises and prints no keys, so both are ``None`` through that path.

Exit codes: 3 = bootstrap failed (worktree rolled back), 4 = refused by
the close-out gate, 7 = ``new`` refused because the base branch is behind
its remote counterpart. Anything else non-zero raises plain ``WtError``.
The numbers are an interface — 4 belongs to close-change.sh's
``REFUSED_EXIT`` and must not be reused by another gate, or a refused
``new`` surfaces as :class:`CloseRefused`.

``wt new`` against a large source home can run ~a minute and prints a
progress line to stderr after ``WT_PROGRESS_AFTER`` seconds; no timeout
is imposed here.

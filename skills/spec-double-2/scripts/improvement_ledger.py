"""SI-04. One improvement record, and ONE reader for it.

A finding in this project is written down in four places, and they have never
been able to answer the same question:

  * `specs/results/skill_feedback.md`                       -- `SF-NNN` blocks
  * `specs/results/deferred_findings_final.yaml`            -- the epic backlog
  * `specs/results/epic-close/deferred_findings_next.yaml`  -- an older backlog
  * `examples/validation/agent_rounds/SELF-IMPROVEMENT-MATRIX.md` -- the bins

Every one of them records where a finding WENT. Not one of them records whether
the substrate CHANGED. `skill_change` is that field -- one grammar, carried by
all four -- and this script is its reader.

    skill_change: none
                | proposed(<unit>, <diff or issue>)
                | applied(<commit>)
                | declined(<reason>)

WHY THIS WRAPS `disposition.py` RATHER THAN REPLACING IT
--------------------------------------------------------
`disposition.py` owns the backlog rows: the duplicate-key structural guard, the
D1/D2/D3 clauses and their deliberately closed vocabulary. Re-implementing any
of that here would put a second opinion about the same bytes in the same
repository -- which is exactly the class `CA-05-DF-06` cost an epic to find,
where a parser silently kept the wrong one of two duplicate keys and the check
certified the result clean. So this file imports that one and adds a single
clause on top:

    D4  a finding anchored to a SKILL is consumed only by a change to that skill

D4 lives here and NOT in `disposition.py`, on purpose and for two reasons.
`disposition.py` refuses (exit 1); this script never does. And `skill_change`
did not exist when any sealed epic closed, so adding D4 to the refusing
instrument would retroactively refuse the whole record on a field nobody could
have filled -- an instrument changed after seeing its own data, which is
`MF-020`, the error this programme has paid for most often.

ADVISORY, AND STRUCTURALLY SO
-----------------------------
There is no exit-code path in this file. `main()` returns None, `__main__`
calls it and falls off the end, and the process exits 0. Not "we remembered to
return 0 on every branch" -- there is no branch that can return anything else,
and no flag that makes it refuse. `GOAL-no-new-gates` is a guard on the ticket
that shipped this, and the cheapest way to keep a guarantee is to make it
unrepresentable to break.

**AND THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH, MEASURED ON THE FIRST RUN.** Having no `sys.exit`
does not make a script exit 0: the first invocation of this file died with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'` and returned 1, because a bare
`python3` here carries no PyYAML (`SF-105`, still open). An uncaught exception
is an exit code like any other. So every source is read through `_guarded`
below, which turns any failure to read one into a printed line and keeps
going -- a ledger that cannot read the matrix still reports the backlogs, and
says which one it lost. The guarantee is "this process exits 0", and an
advisory instrument that crashes on a missing dependency has broken it just as
surely as one that refuses.

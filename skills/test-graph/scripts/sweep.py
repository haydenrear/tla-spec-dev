"""Drive every registered graph ONE AT A TIME, with per-graph resumption.

WHY THIS EXISTS -- DEF-011, and the owner's instruction of 2026-08-24.

UPDATE (OHV-7, DEF-OUN-023): `run.py --all` and `run.py A B C` no longer stop
at the first red graph; they run Gradle with `--continue` and end with a summary
counted from that invocation's own ledger. What remains unique here is per-graph
resumption across a sweep and the CI selector's graph set. The paragraph below
describes run.py before that change.

`run.py --all` hands the whole set to Gradle as one task chain, and Gradle stops
at the first failing task. So a red graph at position 1 yields "stopped at 1",
which is indistinguishable from "only 1 graph exists". Measured 2026-08-21: one
lost teardown race in `smoke` meant 1 of 24 executed and 23 never ran.

`run.py` ALSO REFUSES to combine `--all` with resumption:

    if args.run_all and (args.resume_from_build or replay_node_count):
        parser.error("resume options apply to one graph; pass <graph> instead of --all")

Resumption is per-graph. So "sweep everything" and "resume from the failing
node" cannot both be asked of `--all`, and the owner's instruction -- never
restart from the beginning -- requires driving the graphs individually.

That is this script. One graph at a time; a red graph does NOT stop the sweep;
every graph's outcome is recorded whether it passed or failed; and a graph that
failed can be resumed from its own failing node without re-running the ones
before it.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: decide anything. It records. `graphs_executed` is a count
of graphs whose task RAN, red or green -- `graphs_passed` is the separate
question, and both are written to the report so neither can be inferred from
the other.

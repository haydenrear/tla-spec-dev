#
# WHAT MOVED, AND WHERE ITS COVERAGE WENT
# ---------------------------------------
# The worktree lifecycle — `wt`, new-change.sh, close-change.sh,
# bootstrap-home.sh, agent-home.sh and the shared lib.sh — is now owned by
# `git-issue-workflow`, because a ticket and a worktree exist for EVERY repo
# while an integration repository is a specialization that exists only when a
# repo has constituents. Every check about those files moved WITH them, into
# `git-issue-workflow/scripts/selftest.sh`, and both suites must pass. A
# relocation that dropped a check would be a regression that no longer has a
# suite to show up in, which is the worst kind.
#
# What is left here is what this skill still owns, and it is not "the leftovers":
#
#   * NO ENTRY POINT ACTS ON `--help`, and none takes a flag as a name.
#     git-integration-skill#7 was `propagate.sh --help` running a real fan-out
#     and `init-integration.sh --help` scaffolding a repo called `--help` into
#     the operator's own directory. `refresh.sh` has the same shape and reaches
#     `git reset --hard`. The guard lives in git-issue-workflow's lib.sh now,
#     which is exactly why it is asserted HERE: a dependency's function is not
#     a fact about this skill's scripts until this skill's scripts are measured
#     using it.
#   * EVERY `scripts/<name>` THIS SKILL NAMES, IT SHIPS. The failure this comes
#     from is a page instructing a reader to run a file that is not there.
#   * NO SCRIPT RESOLVES A skill-manager BY A PATH RELATIVE TO ITSELF.
#   * THE GENERAL LIBRARY IS SOURCED, NEVER COPIED. This is the property the
#     whole relocation rests on, so it is measured rather than remembered:
#     nothing here redefines `die`/`info`/`step`/`help_guard`, the resolver has
#     no rung anchored on this file's own location, and when the dependency is
#     genuinely missing every entry point REFUSES with a runnable remedy instead
#     of half-running.
#
# It needs no skill-manager CLI at all — that requirement moved with the home
# machinery — so it runs in seconds and in any checkout.
#
# Nothing outside the scratch directory is read or written.

#                                                      YOU JUST EDITED
#
# integration-lib.sh resolves lib.sh from the INSTALLED home and deliberately
# has no rung relative to its own location — a path relative to where a script
# happens to sit is evidence about the checkout, not about which copy should
# run. That rule is right at RUNTIME and wrong for a TEST: someone editing
# `constituents/git-issue-workflow/scripts/lib.sh` and running this suite from
# the source tree would silently measure the OLD installed lib.sh and see green.
# That is exactly the staleness that let `propagate.sh --help` stay dangerous
# after the fix had merged.
#
# So the harness — and only the harness — prefers the SIBLING SOURCE CHECKOUT
# when one is there, using the pin integration-lib.sh already honours, set
# BEFORE it is sourced so the suite and every child agree on one library. An
# explicit $GIT_ISSUE_WORKFLOW_SCRIPTS from the caller still wins, and with
# neither present this falls through to the installed unit, which is the shape

# at all, the same script is run in the same fixture with a REAL argument first,

# always instructed a reader to run, so the floor is stated as membership
# rather than as a count that drifts.

# from disk makes grep exit 2 and, under `set -u -e`, would abort the suite
# before the assertion that is about exactly that case could run. Measured while
# writing the mutation proof for this very check.
# `(^|[^/…])scripts/…` — a LEADING SLASH disqualifies the match. Since the
# worktree machinery moved to git-issue-workflow, this skill's pages name that
# skill's files the way every cross-unit path in these skills is named:
# `\$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/skills/git-issue-workflow/scripts/wt`. Those resolve
# inside a DIFFERENT unit and are not this skill's to ship, and sweeping them up
# would make the rule below assert the opposite of what it means. A bare
# `scripts/<name>` — at a line start, after a space, a backtick or a quote — is
# still a promise about THIS skill, and is still checked.
# `xargs -0 grep`, NOT `xargs -0 command grep`. xargs execs its argument

# Workflows

This reference describes the operational paths for projects that use an
evolving TLA+ program spec plus generated Python spec doubles.

## Scaffold A Project

Use this when a repository is adopting the desired/current loop after it already
has or is about to create an accepted `program_model`.

```bash
tla-spec-dev --spec-root specs scaffold project --name ProjectName
tla-spec-dev --spec-root specs scaffold workflow TICKET-123 "Ticket title"
```

This creates:

- `specs/program_model`
- `specs/desired_program_model`
- `specs/current`

For first onboarding of a repository with no accepted baseline, prefer
`tla-spec-dev --spec-root specs scaffold project --name ProjectName` and stop
there so only `specs/program_model` is created. Use the same `--spec-root` for
every later workflow command when the repository does not use `specs`.

The scaffold emits placeholders to restructure, not a finished baseline. It is
complete only when it carries both views (`Internal.tla` + `External.tla`), both
adapter mappings (`case_adapters.toml` + `testgraph_bindings.yml`), and the
adapters/projector/assertion in `adapters.py`. Read
`references/testgraph_adapters.md` and diff against
`examples/distributed_history/specs/program_model/` before calling it done.

## Scaffold A Spec

`scripts/scaffold_spec.py` is for **standalone tutorial/example specs only**.

```bash
python3 scripts/scaffold_spec.py workspace --root examples
```

Do not use it for production `specs/current` or `specs/desired_program_model`
work. It always emits both views (Core + Internal + External; `--views` is
additive only) because a single-module spec with no External view cannot
generate Test Graph cases — the project's public surface would never
be validated. Production baselines come from
`tla-spec-dev scaffold project`, and `specs/current` /
`specs/desired_program_model` are created from that accepted baseline by
`tla-spec-dev scaffold workflow`. Keep tickets in
`specs/desired_program_model/ticket_plan.yaml`.

## Work A Ticket

1. Update `specs/desired_program_model` with the intended whole-program state.
2. Update `specs/desired_program_model/ticket_plan.yaml` with the ticket id,
   status, dependencies, validation commands, and evidence slots.
3. Start the ticket workspace:

```bash
tla-spec-dev --spec-root specs open ticket <ticket-id>
```

4. Update `specs/tickets/<ticket-id>/desired` first. The ticket desired model is
   the whole-program state after this ticket, including TLA+, configs,
   spec-unit adapters/tests, and Test Graph bindings/adapters when applicable.
5. Update production code plus `specs/tickets/<ticket-id>/current`.
6. Run TLC and generated/adapted case tests for the selected slice:

```bash
tla-spec-dev --spec-root specs run spec-unit-tests --ticket <ticket-id>
```

7. Store evidence under the ticket `results/` directory or another referenced
   evidence path.
7a. **Attribute what the ticket hit, while you are still in it.** For each
   regression: what caught it (`channel`), what area it was in, and the
   assertion that pins it — or why none was added. For each case you wrote that
   passes: what it could **never** have caught, or `UNDECIDED` if you did not
   work it out. **Written now, not reconstructed at close** — memory
   reconstructs favourably. Nothing gates on this.
   See `references/bug_attribution.md` §4 and §6.
7b. **Name the TLA+ action each regression happened inside, and REPORT IT
   UPWARD.** `<Module>.<Action>` from `specs/program_model/`, or
   `UNMODELED/<bin>` where `<bin>` NAMES what it sits beneath — do not stretch an
   action to cover something it does not mean. **Name the bin even if it is the
   first finding in it**: an unnamed bin is pooled, and a pooled count cannot
   tell one gap from five. Prompts, skills, and several skills composed inside
   one plugin are bins, not actions — nothing can drive them today, and that is
   recorded rather than skipped. See `references/bug_attribution.md` §7c. One line per regression, in the ticket close-out and the PR.
   **Do NOT edit the self-improvement matrix.** The epic agent is its only
   writer; a ticket that edits it creates the naming drift the anchor exists to
   prevent. See `examples/validation/agent_rounds/SELF-IMPROVEMENT-MATRIX.md`.
7c. **If you caught it by hand, ask whether a binding could have caught it —
   and if it is cheap, add it NOW.** For each regression whose channel class is
   `hand` or `reading`: does the action it happened inside have a test graph
   binding (an adapter, a projector and an assertion, so TLC-derived cases can
   drive it and a node can go red)? **An action taking hand-catches with no
   binding is a place nothing has ever looked.**
   - **Cheap** — add the binding in this ticket. It is ordinary work, it needs no
     permission, and it is not "more tests": at an unbound action it duplicates
     nothing and is derived from the model rather than from the bug you just
     read. See `prompts/regression_architecture.md`, "What not to do".
   - **Not cheap** — say what about the code makes the action hard to drive, and
     report it upward with a forward price. **That is a refactor proposed for
     OBSERVABILITY**, which is a different claim from one proposed for
     simplicity, and the epic agent weighs them against each other.
   Either way this is a line in the close-out, not an edit to the matrix.
   See `references/bug_attribution.md` §5 and §7b.
8. Fill in the ticket's complexity-ledger input,
   `specs/tickets/<ticket-id>/results/complexity_ledger.yaml` (scaffolded by
   `open ticket` with TODO sentinels that fail the gate). The close refuses
   until it carries a refinement record, a narrative, a justification for any
   complexity increase, and validated-refactor evidence for any decrease.
   There is no override flag.
9. Mark the ticket closed in `ticket_plan.yaml`.
10. Close the ticket:

```bash
tla-spec-dev --spec-root specs close ticket <ticket-id> \
  --summary "What changed and why" \
  --result specs/results/tlc.txt \
  --result specs/results/adapter.txt
```

The close operation validates ticket-local `current == desired`, records a
complexity-ledger entry in `specs/results/complexity_ledger.json` (refusing
the close if the ledger gate rejects), moves `specs/tickets/<ticket-id>` to
`specs/.history/<workflow-name>/ticket-NNN-<ticket-id>/ticket/`, promotes
ticket `desired/` onto project `specs/current` — removing only paths that
were seeded into the ticket workspace and dropped there, and preserving
current-only files the ticket was never seeded with — and merges ticket-local
Test Graph artifacts into project specs.

The lower-level scripts remain implementation details behind the CLI. The
tla-spec-dev repository validates this CLI flow with its parent Test
Graph:

```bash
# NOT `~/.skill-manager`: the test-graph unit lives in the home THIS checkout is
# bound to (a project or worktree `.skill-manager`), and only that copy matches
# the units this checkout was resolved against. See references/runtime_requirements.md.
"$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME"/skills/test-graph/scripts/discover.py specWorkflow
"$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME"/skills/test-graph/scripts/run.py specWorkflow
```

## Complete A Spec Workflow

Use this when the desired/current loop has been mapped back into the durable
program model.

1. Confirm every ticket in `specs/desired_program_model/ticket_plan.yaml` has a
   closed status.
2. Confirm project `specs/current` and `specs/desired_program_model`
   semantically match.
3. Promote the converged model into `specs/program_model`.
4. Fill in the workflow-close ledger input,
   `specs/results/complexity_ledger_input.yaml`. It must include a
   `coverage_audit` block. Since 2026-08-04 it REFUSES NOTHING — the verdict is
   recorded and printed at every close, `not_run` included — but `pass` is still
   the only value that means "the surface was walked and no in-scope gap was
   found". Run `prompts/coverage_audit.md` if you want that read, and record the
   report path. See `references/coverage_audit.md`, "Status".
4a. **Write the attribution section of the close-out or evaluation.** Four
   questions, answered from the record by reading it — there is no tool and one
   is not wanted:
   - **CATCH** — per architectural area, how many regressions were caught by
     something `automated` and how many escaped to a `hand` or to `reading`.
   - **REACH** — which invariants are enforced on some surfaces and not others,
     and which claim full coverage without saying how they enumerated.
   - **BLIND** — which passing cases could never have caught the areas that keep
     escaping. A green sitting on an escaping area is the strongest single
     signal here.
   - **PRICE** — which proposals were priced before, and what they actually
     cost.
   Then say **what the record could not show**: how much of it carries an
   attribution at all, and which areas have escapes but **no denominator** —
   an area with one escape in two invocations and one with one escape in a
   hundred look identical until you say so. A clean report off a thin record
   certifies an absence nobody observed.

4b. **THE ARCHITECTURAL READ — a required task of the evaluation, and the epic
   agent owns it.** Collect the anchors every ticket reported upward, place them
   in `SELF-IMPROVEMENT-MATRIX.md`, and run
   `prompts/regression_architecture.md` over it. It asks which TLA+ actions keep
   appearing in `escaped to hand` **across rounds**, whether the worst one is
   too complex and due a refactor, **and what is working** — an action with a
   closed arc is the result the programme is for, and a matrix that records only
   problems will recommend churn. It must price forward and must not choose.
   **If the model is refactored, every affected row is explicitly CARRIED or
   DROPPED in the carry-through log** — that is the only time the matrix is
   rewritten, and it is a decision, never an inference over sealed history.
   **Judge the transcripts with `prompts/regression_judge.md`, two judges, blind
   to each other and to the matrix** — a self-graded attribution is the verdict
   an agent has an incentive to give.
   **It asks for TWO responses at the worst action and forces a choice between
   them:** *reduce* its complexity, or *expand* the model and bind the place the
   defects land. They point in opposite directions — one shrinks the model
   surface, the other grows it — and picking the shrinking one for an action
   nobody ever checked for a binding is simplifying a place that was never
   observed.
   **If the model moves, findings are CONSERVED.** Every affected finding
   re-anchors; the carry-through entry states `findings before` and `findings
   after` and they must be equal. There is no rule against removing an action —
   reducing complexity where defects aggregate is one of the two responses this
   programme wants, and it legitimately removes model surface. Conservation makes
   removal harmless instead of forbidden, and it is checked by summing a column.
   See `references/bug_attribution.md` §7b.
   **The direction of travel is findings spread across MORE of the model over
   time, while escapes at each action fall.** Read those two together: escapes
   falling at an action whose `automated` catches also stayed at zero has not
   improved, it has gone quiet, and that is a BLIND rather than a win.
   **No checker, gate, lint or static analyzer may be proposed as the answer.**
   That route is measured and closed here; if one is ever built it goes in a
   separate library. Nothing gates on any of this.
   See `references/bug_attribution.md` and
   `examples/validation/agent_rounds/SELF-IMPROVEMENT-MATRIX.md`.

5. Record a closed-workflow snapshot and remove temporary workflow directories:

```bash
python scripts/close_tickets.py \
  --repo-root . \
  --summary "Final mapping from desired/current into program_model"
```

The close record is written to
`specs/.history/<workflow-name>/closed-snapshot/`.

## Search Before Reading

For historical questions, search manifests and summaries first:

```bash
rg -n "<ticket-id>|<action>|<invariant>|<resource>" specs/.history
```

Open snapshots only after the manifest or summary proves relevance. This keeps
AI-assisted maintenance focused on the current state plus a small number of
append-only historical entries.

# Goals and evaluation

An epic exists to move something measurable. Tickets that only reference their
own slice optimize local correctness and leave the epic's actual outcome
unmeasured — every ticket passes, the epic ships, and nobody can say whether the
thing got faster, more accurate, or more reliable.

The fix is one primitive: an epic declares **goals**, one or more terminal
**evaluation tickets** own the harness that decides them, and **every ticket
declares how it relates to at least one goal**. That relation is load-bearing
context: it tells the ticket agent what result its change is supposed to
produce, which cheap local signal predicts it, and which final measurement it
will be judged by.

Goals are agreed with the user at epic creation, alongside the deferment policy
(`deferment.md`). Do not infer them from the codebase and do not default them.

## What counts as a goal

A goal is a specific, falsifiable claim about the program after the epic, with
a named instrument that decides it. Write goals as outcomes, not as work.

| Not a goal | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| "Refactor the ingest path" | "p99 ingest latency ≤ 250ms at 5k rps, throughput not regressed" |
| "Improve retrieval" | "Answer-match eval ≥ 0.82 on `evals/retrieval_v3.jsonl`, from 0.71" |
| "Add integration tests" | "The `epicIntegration` graph passes end to end with no skipped nodes" |

Goal kinds:

- **`perf`** — latency, throughput, memory, cost; needs a baseline run and a
  target expressed against it.
- **`eval`** — accuracy/quality judged against a fixed artifact set; needs a
  pinned dataset and scorer version, or — for a judged instrument — a pinned
  rubric version and a stated judging setup.
- **`integration`** — a named end-to-end Test Graph or system path passing under
  realistic composition, not per-ticket units.
- **`quality`** — an invariant/coverage/robustness property with a deciding
  command (TLC model, fuzz budget, conformance suite).

Every goal names one deciding instrument. A goal nobody can decide is a slogan;
either find the harness, schedule a wave-1 ticket that builds it, or drop the
goal.

### The instrument does not have to be a command

For a long time this file said "one deciding command", and its only worked
example was a benchmark script. That framing is too narrow, and the project's
own flagship consumer already runs outside it: `tla-spec-dev`'s
`ports-as-adapters` epic declares goals whose harness reads

> the HP-01-shaped seeded catalogue extended with adapter-internal faults, run
> against real and fake wirings, **scored by two blind judges**

which is a procedure, not a command line. That repository moved to judged
scoring deliberately and on evidence, and states the reason itself: *"A number
computed from the artifact can be optimized by editing the artifact. A
judgement that must cite the artifact can only be satisfied by changing what
the artifact is"* (`tla-spec-dev/references/eval_scorecard.md`). That file is
the worked example of a judged instrument and **the sole authority on its own
dimensions, anchors, scoring rules, judging protocol, storage, sealing and
history rules**. This file cites it and restates none of them.

So a `harness` is whatever **decides the goal reproducibly and independently of
the person hoping it passed**. Three shapes all qualify:

- **a command** — a benchmark, an eval scorer, a graph run. Write the exact
  invocation;
- **a judged procedure** — an artifact scored against a versioned rubric by
  judges who cite the artifact, blind to arm where arms exist. Write what is
  scored, by how many judges, under which rubric version, and where the
  evidence lands;
- **a mixed instrument** — measured figures recorded beside a judged score, read
  together rather than combined. How the two are reconciled is the instrument's
  rule to state, not this file's.

What is still forbidden is an instrument nobody can execute at all. "The design
feels cleaner" names no instrument; "scored against `<rubric>` version N by two
blind judges, results under `<evidence_root>`" names one, and the fact that a
human runs it does not make it unfalsifiable.

**Name the instrument; do not copy it.** Write which rubric, which version, how
many judges, and where the evidence lands — and then link the rubric. Never
restate its dimensions, its anchors, its scoring rules or its comparability
rules here. A rubric's own repository versions those and executes checks over
them; a copy in this file is covered by nothing and will drift. `tla-spec-dev`
learned this by measurement: a charter there restated a table of judged results
and two of its rows were wrong, read forward across a change to the instrument
before anyone noticed.

### Not every target is a number

A target states what counts as success. Usually that is a threshold, but two
legitimate shapes are not:

- **A multi-clause target.** `GOAL-port-reach` targets "the same adapter-internal
  fault dies on at least one generated instrument, **and** no positive control is
  red" — two independent clauses that can settle differently, and did.
- **A goal with deliberately no numeric target**, where the epic is building the
  instrument itself. `GOAL-complexity-measurable` says it outright: *"NO TARGET
  ON THE NUMBER ITSELF — a threshold before anything can produce a number would
  be inventing the answer."* Its baseline is "no such instrument exists". A
  first-measurement goal is decided by whether the instrument runs and
  discriminates, not by a figure chosen before anything could produce one.

Write either plainly in `target`. Do not manufacture a threshold to make the
field look conventional — an invented number is the failure this whole primitive
exists to prevent, and it is worse than an honest "no target on the number".

## Ask the user at epic creation

Ask before scaffolding the workflow, and ask concretely:

> What should be measurably better when this epic is done? For each outcome I
> need: the metric, the instrument that decides it — a command, or a judged
> procedure with its rubric — its value today, and the
> threshold that counts as success. If a harness does not exist yet, I will
> schedule a wave-1 ticket to build it and measure the baseline before the
> tickets that change behavior.
>
> I will add a final evaluation ticket that runs those measurements on the
> integrated epic branch, and every other ticket will declare how it moves each
> metric so its agent knows what result it is aiming at.

Push back on unmeasurable answers once, offering the nearest measurable form.
If the user genuinely has no measurable outcome (pure refactor, docs, plumbing),
record that decision explicitly rather than inventing a metric:

```yaml
epic_goals: []
goals_waived: "<user's reason: no behavioral delta; correctness held by existing suites>"
```

The validator warns on a waived or missing goal set; it does not block. A waived
epic still runs its normal ticket validation matrices.

## Baselines

A target without a baseline cannot be evaluated — "p99 ≤ 250ms" is unfalsifiable
if nobody knows today's number.

- **Harness exists** — measure at epic kickoff on the freshly created epic
  branch, before any ticket lands. Commit the measurement under the epic
  evidence root and record its value and commit SHA in the goal.
- **Harness does not exist** — schedule a wave-1 ticket whose slice is the
  harness plus the baseline run. Every behavior-changing ticket depends on it.
  Until it merges, the goal's `baseline.value` stays `unmeasured` and the
  validator warns.

Never take the baseline after the first behavioral ticket has merged; that
measures the epic against itself.

**A judged baseline is a prior scored run, not a recollection.** Where the
instrument is a judged one, `baseline.value` cites the sealed card that produced
the number and `baseline.evidence` points at it, so the comparison is against a
record that cannot be edited afterwards. Two consequences follow, both learned
the hard way in `ports-as-adapters`:

- **A baseline can be superseded before the epic starts.** A wider or repaired
  instrument may have re-measured the same thing since. Move the bar to the
  newer number, say which run it came from, and leave the superseded run sealed
  and unedited on the record — measuring divergence against a weaker instrument
  credits movement the better one absorbs.
- **A number measured on one instrument is not comparable across a repair of
  that instrument.** If the instrument changed between baseline and measurement,
  say so and treat the movement as a fact about the instrument until proven
  otherwise. `tla-spec-dev` executes this as a rule and an audit; the general
  point is that "the number moved" and "the thing got better" are different
  claims.

A baseline of `unmeasured` is honest and warns; a baseline of "no such
instrument exists" is the normal state of a goal whose epic is building the
instrument, and it belongs in the field verbatim rather than as a guess.

## Plan schema

`epic_goals` sits at the root of
`specs/desired_program_model/ticket_plan.yaml`, next to `deferment_policy`:

```yaml
epic_goals:
  - id: GOAL-ingest-p99            # stable, never reused, never renamed
    kind: perf                     # perf | eval | integration | quality
    statement: "Batched ingest cuts tail latency without losing throughput."
    metric: "p99 ingest latency (ms) at 5k rps; throughput (events/s)"
    harness: "uv run scripts/bench_ingest.py --profile epic --out <evidence>"
    baseline:
      value: "p99 412ms, 5.1k events/s"     # or: unmeasured
      measured_at: "<commit sha the baseline ran on>"
      evidence: "results/epic-<slug>/baseline/ingest.json"
    target: "p99 <= 250ms and throughput >= 5.0k events/s"
    evaluation_ticket: "EPIC-9"     # ticket with role: evaluation that decides it
    evidence_root: "results/epic-<slug>/goals/GOAL-ingest-p99"
```

Each ticket gains a `goals` list, and evaluation tickets gain `role` and
`owns_goals`:

```yaml
tickets:
  - id: EPIC-3
    # ...existing scheduling fields...
    goals:
      - goal: GOAL-ingest-p99
        contribution: direct            # direct | enabling | guard
        expected_effect: "-120ms p99 from write batching; throughput unchanged"
        local_signal: "uv run scripts/bench_ingest.py --profile ticket --quick"

  - id: EPIC-9
    role: evaluation                    # omit or use `implementation` elsewhere
    owns_goals: ["GOAL-ingest-p99"]
    goals:
      - goal: GOAL-ingest-p99
        contribution: guard
        expected_effect: "decides the goal; adds no behavioral delta"
        local_signal: "N/A: this ticket is the measurement"
```

Contribution kinds:

- **`direct`** — this ticket's change is expected to move the metric. Requires a
  numeric or directional `expected_effect` and, wherever possible, a
  `local_signal` the agent can run inside its own worktree.
- **`enabling`** — no expected movement on its own; it unblocks a `direct`
  ticket (harness, refactor, plumbing, fixture). `expected_effect` states
  `none — enabling only` plus what it unblocks.
- **`guard`** — the ticket must not regress this metric even though it targets
  another goal. `local_signal` is the regression check.

## Scheduling rules the validator enforces

When `epic_goals` is non-empty:

- every goal is referenced by at least one non-evaluation ticket — a goal no
  ticket contributes to is a goal nobody is working on;
- every ticket declares at least one goal entry;
- each goal's `evaluation_ticket` exists and carries `role: evaluation`;
- every contributing ticket **reaches its goal's evaluation ticket** through
  `depends_on`, so the evaluation cannot start before the work it evaluates;
- every contributing ticket promotes **before** that evaluation ticket in the
  promotion lane.

Mirror those `depends_on` edges into GitHub with `--add-blocked-by` like any
other dependency, so the tracker shows the evaluation ticket blocked by its
contributors.

Missing goals, a missing evaluation ticket, an `unmeasured` baseline, and a
`direct` contribution with no local signal are **warnings**: the plan still
validates, and the epic owner decides. Inconsistencies inside a declared goal
set (unknown goal IDs, an evaluation ticket that promotes before its
contributors, a goal with no contributor) are **errors**.

## What the ticket agent does with it

The assignment block carries the goal context, and the ticket agent:

1. reads its goal entries **before** implementing, and treats
   `expected_effect` as the result it is aiming at, not decoration;
2. runs `local_signal` before close and records the number under the ticket
   evidence root — this is a signal, not a gate: a missed local signal is
   reported, not hidden, and never justifies weakening the REQUIRED matrix;
3. reports the measured local signal against `expected_effect` in the PR body's
   `## Goal contribution` section, including "no measurable movement" outcomes;
4. files a deferred finding (`deferment.md`) when it discovers the goal is
   unreachable by the planned slice, rather than expanding scope to chase the
   metric.

A ticket whose local signal moves the wrong way is not automatically a failed
ticket — the integrated evaluation decides. It is, however, always reported.

## What the evaluation ticket does

An evaluation ticket is a real ticket: it has a slice, a spec ticket, and a
close record. Its slice is the measurement, not the behavior. It:

- promotes last among the contributors to the goals it owns;
- runs each owned goal's `harness` on the integrated epic tip, from a fresh
  start, and writes results under the goal's `evidence_root`;
- reports **baseline → measured → target** and a verdict per goal — **one
  verdict per clause** where the target has more than one (see below);
- files deferred findings for regressions it uncovers instead of fixing them;
- never edits the target to match the result, and never re-runs selectively
  until a number passes. Report the run that happened.

An evaluation ticket that finds a goal missed does not fail the epic on its own.
It hands the epic owner a decision: add a ticket, accept the shortfall with a
recorded reason, or re-scope the goal — all at finalization.

## Finalization

The epic PR reports every goal as a row — and every **clause** of a goal as its
own row:

| Goal | Clause | Kind | Baseline | Measured | Target | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Verdicts are `met`, `missed`, or `unmeasured` (with a reason). An epic may close
with a missed goal only when the user has explicitly accepted it and the reason
is recorded in the PR body. Never close with a silently unmeasured goal: run it,
or say why it could not run.

**A goal verdict is not always one word.** Where a target has several clauses,
each is measured and reported separately; `GOAL-port-reach` settled as *clause 1
met, clause 2 not met*, and a single token could not have carried that. The
reason to insist is not tidiness — a ledger that stores one verdict per
multi-clause goal has to choose which clause the word refers to, **and it will
choose the flattering one**. Use `—` in the Clause column for a single-clause
goal so the shape stays uniform.

A goal whose target is deliberately not a number (an instrument-building goal)
is still reported here: `Measured` is what the instrument produced on its first
real run, `Target` restates the no-threshold decision, and the verdict says
whether the instrument ran and discriminated.

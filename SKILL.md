name: git-issue-workflow
description: >-
  Use when handed a GitHub issue to implement — a pasted issue body, a URL, a bare
  "#N", or `gh issue view` output — or asked to start, pick up, work on,
  complete, or close out a ticket, including one assigned from a shared epic spec
  workflow. SHIPS THE WORKTREE FRONT DOOR every ticket in every repo starts and
  ends with, so never hand-roll one: `scripts/wt new <ticket>` creates the
  worktree AND its own per-checkout Skill Manager home in one command, and
  `scripts/wt close <ticket>` tears it down through a gate that refuses while
  removing it would destroy unpublished skill work. Same command in a plain repo
  and an integration repo; it detects which. The skt plugin's `skt ticket
  new|close` wraps the same lifecycle, is on PATH in skt-carrying homes, and is
  preferred when present. Read BEFORE touching the repo: the
  issue body is a work order, and the
  `git-epic-workflow:assignment` marker selects a higher-priority epic mode before
  ordinary or integration provisioning. Epic tickets branch from the declared
  `origin/epic/*`, close/promote only their assigned spec ticket with evidence, and
  open a PR back to the epic branch for external review. Unmarked tickets retain
  the ordinary/integration flow: worktree provisioning, current→desired validation,
  workflow/issue close-out, merge verification, and integration fan-out. A ticket
  that declares a goal reads its expected effect before implementing, runs the
  declared local signal as advisory evidence, and reports goal contribution in the
  PR; a `role: evaluation` ticket runs the goal instrument — a command or a
  judged rubric — on the integrated epic tip and reports a met/missed/unmeasured
  verdict per goal clause. Trigger
  on "implement this issue", "complete this ticket", "pick up issue #N", "work
  this epic ticket", "run the evaluation ticket", "open the MR", or "propagate the
  integration change".
  Also use when receiving an agent-tagged PR from an integration MR.

# git-issue-workflow

## The one command: `wt`

Before anything else, because it is the first thing every ticket does and the
last thing every ticket does:

```bash
WT="${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/skills/git-issue-workflow/scripts/wt"

"$WT" new   <ticket>     # worktree + its OWN Skill Manager home, launchable
"$WT" close <ticket>     # teardown, through the close-out gate
```

That is the whole happy path, and it costs one line of output each:

```
created worktree /path/to/<repo>-<ticket>
closed worktree /path/to/<repo>-<ticket> (branch feature/<ticket> kept; home work went no further than /path/to/repo/.skill-manager — push skill edits from there)
```

**Nothing else is ever on that line.** Anything a caller acts on is a keyed
contract line, not prose — `"$WT" info <ticket>`, or `--verbose` on the run that
creates it. The commit a worktree was branched from is the `BASE` key there.

**`cd` to the path `new` printed.** It is `<parent>/<repo>-<ticket>`, not
`../wt-<ticket>`, so do not guess it. `wt` is **not on `PATH`** — the spelling
above is a path that resolves, which is why it is written out; an installed
unit's files live at `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/skills/<unit>/`, and the `:-` fallback
makes the same line work from a bare shell.

**`skt ticket` is the same door, discoverable.** Homes carrying the `skt`
plugin put `skt` on PATH and disclose it at session start; `skt ticket
new|close|info <ticket>` imports this skill's Python surface
(`src/git_issue_workflow/`) and drives the same `wt` underneath — same
contract, same gate, plus guided remedies on refusal. Prefer it when present;
everything below remains the source of truth for what it does.

**Test for `skt` with one command, not by looking around.** It is a *plugin*, so
it is never under a home's `skills/` — an agent that lists that directory
concludes it is absent from a home that has it. Ask the shell, because the
checkout's own home puts its `bin/cli` on PATH and `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` is
often unset:

```bash
command -v skt       # prints a path -> use `skt ticket new|close <ticket>` and stop looking
```

Only if that prints nothing, use this skill's own script, from the checkout's
project home first and the operator's home second:

```bash
WT=./.skill-manager/skills/git-issue-workflow/scripts/wt
[ -x "$WT" ] || WT="${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/skills/git-issue-workflow/scripts/wt"
```

**Do not substitute `git worktree add`.** It produces a worktree with no Skill
Manager home, and an agent launched there writes the operator's global
`~/.skill-manager`. Do not substitute `git worktree remove` either: it deletes
the home, and every unpushed skill edit in it, without a word.

A failure is three lines, and the second runs **as printed**:

```
error creating worktree: no Skill Manager home could be created for this worktree (usually: /path/to/repo has no project home yet)
fix: /path/to/home/skills/git-issue-workflow/scripts/bootstrap-home.sh --root /path/to/repo
log: /tmp/wt-XXXXXX-run.log
```

Exit **3** with "no project home yet" is the common one, on the first ticket in
a repository that has never been given a home. Run the `fix:` line verbatim —
once per repository, not per worktree — and re-run `wt new`. The exception is an
environment that refuses writes (a sandbox's "Operation not permitted"): the
`fix:` line fails the same way there, so report it rather than running it.

Exit **7** is the branch point: a bare base name resolves to the **local** ref,
and a local `epic/*` branch does not advance when its ticket PRs are merged
server-side. `new` refreshes the base's own remote ref first and refuses if the
local one is behind it; the `fix:` line branches from the published tip.
`--stale-base-ok` takes the local ref deliberately and says so on **stderr**,
leaving stdout unchanged. `WT_FETCH=0` skips the refresh when offline. See
`references/worktrees.md` § *The branch point*.

Exit **1** with "working tree is not clean" is the parent checkout having
uncommitted files. Creating a worktree never reads or writes them: pass
`--dirty-ok` (or `WT_DIRTY_OK=1`, or `SKILL_GATES=off`) and it proceeds with one
warning line. Never stash, commit, or discard someone's edits to get past it.

A bootstrap refusal saying the CLI "is the entrypoint of the home X … NOTHING IS
OUT OF DATE" (exit **79**) is a home mismatch, not an old CLI: the CLI it found
binds a different home than the one being bootstrapped. Re-run naming the right
home's CLI — `SKILL_MANAGER_CLI=<repo>/.skill-manager/bin/cli/skill-manager` —
and never upgrade or reinstall skill-manager to get past it.

**Reaching a by-hand route is itself a finding — report it.** This skill spells
out a manual equivalent in two places: the chained
`git worktree add && bootstrap-home.sh` in `references/epic-ticket.md` §2, and
the raw `home close-out && git worktree remove` under step 4a below. Each is
written for a repository that genuinely has no front door — **and because each
one works, an agent that merely could not *find* the front door lands on it,
produces a plausible result, and leaves no trace but the cost.** Four eval runs
did exactly that, for four different reasons, and none of them reported a
problem.

So run the `command -v skt` test above first. If it printed nothing and neither
`wt` path exists, the by-hand route is correct and there is nothing to report.
If either resolved and you are on the by-hand route anyway, say so in one line,
naming which it was:

- `skt` is installed but was not on `PATH`;
- you looked where it never is (`skills/` for a plugin);
- you found it and it **failed** — quote its `error:` line verbatim;
- you found it and could not read the home it pointed at.

All four are front-door defects, not facts about the repository. Put the line
where this ticket's work is reported — the PR body, or to the user when there is
no PR — and file it against this skill.

Everything else is on demand and costs nothing until asked:
`"$WT" info <ticket>` prints WORKTREE / BRANCH / LAUNCH / IF-EXIT-8 / CLOSE (and
PROPAGATE, only in an integration repo). `BASE` — the commit branched from — is
on the run that CREATES the worktree, since that is the only run that measured
it: `new-change.sh` stdout, or `"$WT" new <ticket> --verbose`. `references/worktrees.md` explains why
each line is what it is; the happy path does not need it.

**This is the same command in a plain repo and an integration repo**, and in a
constituent of one — `wt` detects which it is standing in. A repo with no
constituents needs nothing else installed: `git-integration-repo` is a
*specialization* for repos that have them, and nothing above touches it.

---

The **implementer side** of `git-issue`. A work order created by the `git-issue`
skill names the moves — worktree, spec workflow, regression graphs, close-out.
This skill is how an agent actually **runs** them. An epic assignment stops at a
PR into its shared epic branch; an ordinary ticket runs end to end (and, for an
integration repo, fans out to every constituent).

For ordinary and integration tickets it covers two downstream devops roles:

- **Role 2 — Provision (kick off).** Read the issue, set up the worktree and
  feature branch(es), detect whether this is an integration repo, and open the
  spec workflow so the branch starts spec-first. See `references/provision.md`.
- **Role 3 — Perform (complete).** Implement, run the current→desired validation
  loop until green, close the spec workflow and the GitHub issue, verify the
  merge, open the PR, and — for an integration repo — fan out per-constituent
  branches/PRs with agent tags. See `references/complete.md`.

`git-issue` files the work; this skill executes it. The role-1 author uses
`git-issue`; roles 2 and 3 use this skill. They can be the same agent in one
session or three different agents across a handoff. Epic assignments use the
same issue as their work order but deliberately leave the GitHub issue and epic
workflow open after the ticket PR is created.

## Select epic mode before any provisioning

Read the complete issue body before choosing a branch, worktree, repository mode,
or spec command. Search for the exact marker:

```text
<!-- git-epic-workflow:assignment:start -->
```

- **Marker present:** this is epic ticket mode. Read
  `references/epic-ticket.md` and follow it instead of Role 2, Role 3, the
  ordinary close-out sequence, or integration fan-out. The assignment's declared
  branch, worktree, ticket, validation, promotion, and PR base are authoritative.
  This selection happens even when the checkout also has integration-repo markers.
  An assignment whose `ticket.role` is `evaluation` decides goals instead of
  producing a behavioral delta — read `references/goal-signal.md` alongside
  `references/epic-ticket.md` before provisioning it.
- **Marker absent:** continue with the existing PLAIN/INTEGRATION detection and
  ordinary procedures below.

Do not scaffold a workflow, create a default-branch worktree, or run an
integration provisioning script until this marker check is complete. An epic
assignment overrides ordinary instructions that say to branch from, merge to, or
sync the default branch.

## Three load-bearing rules for ordinary and integration tickets

These decide most of the mechanics — get them wrong and the rest breaks.

1. **Operate specs and the test graph only from the parent.** When the ticket
   spans sub-repos (an integration repo), you run the TLA+ spec workflow and the
   `test_graph` graphs **once, at the integration parent**, whose worktree holds
   every constituent's files as plain files. You do **not** run per-constituent
   specs/graphs during the ticket. Each constituent re-runs its own loops later,
   after fan-out, when it receives its agent-tagged PR
   (`references/agent-tag-pr.md`).
2. **Same branch name everywhere.** The ticket id drives one branch name —
   `feature/<ticket>` — on the parent and on every constituent, so a single change
   stays traceable across the parent PR and every sub-repo PR.
3. **A ticket lives in a worktree, never the primary checkout.** Generated spec
   doubles and manifests land on the feature branch from creation; the main tree
   stays clean so `git-integration-repo`'s constituent `.git`s are undisturbed.

## Your Skill Manager home IS the worktree's

The skills you are running are not the operator's. On a machine with per-checkout
homes there are three tiers, and **each is a real copy, not a symlink**:

```
root       ~/.skill-manager              where the operator installs
   |  copy
project    <repo>/.skill-manager         one per repository, gitignored
   |  copy
worktree   <worktree>/.skill-manager     YOURS, for this ticket, gitignored
```

Copies, because a link is a single shared object: two tickets editing "their"
copy of a skill would be editing each other's, and last writer wins silently.
Your worktree home is the whole reason you can improve a skill mid-ticket at all.

Two consequences you have to act on, and neither is optional:

- **Launch through the home's shims**, `<worktree>/.skill-manager/bin/launch/{claude,codex,gemini}`,
  or `skill-manager exec`. Exporting `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` by hand gets you the
  part you remembered: skills also load from the Claude config dir, and
  `skill-script` CLI wrappers are generated shell scripts with a home's absolute
  path in the body, which no variable redirects. The shims apply the whole
  contract.
- **An edit you make to a skill inside that home is in no diff.** The home is
  gitignored, so `git add -A` never sees it, the parent PR cannot carry it, and
  `git worktree remove` deletes it without a word — succeeding exactly as
  quietly whether the home held a week of work or nothing. Getting it out is
  step 4 of the close-out sequence below, and it is a gate, not a reminder.

Downward (root → project → worktree) is a copy and needs nothing from you.
**Upward is the whole difficulty**, and it is why the close-out order matters.

**A copy is not a copy of everything the home can do**, and that is deliberate:
your worktree home inherits some of its parent's derived artifacts and only
declares the rest. Go to
`${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/plugins/skt/skills/skt/references/derived-artifacts.md` (absent in a home that does not have the skt plugin installed)
— not to the source — if any of these is your question:

- `skill-manager artifacts list` shows rows I do not understand, or
  `artifacts stale` reports a count on a home I have not touched;
- a command on my `PATH` refuses instead of running;
- is this fresh home broken, or is this what a healthy one looks like?
- should I rebuild something, and how?

**Do not diagnose a new worktree home from the source.** That page exists
because the last two agents who did got the root cause wrong, in opposite
directions. If that path is not there, the page is `skills/skt/references/derived-artifacts.md` in `github.com/haydenrear/skill-publisher-skill` — read it there, or `skill-manager install github:haydenrear/skill-publisher-skill`. Do not fall back to reading the CLI source; that is what produced the two wrong answers the page exists to correct.

## Is this an integration repo?

Decide first — it changes provisioning and fan-out. It **is** an integration repo
when the repo root carries the `git-integration-repo` markers:

```bash
test -f INTEGRATION.md && test -f integration.toml && echo INTEGRATION || echo PLAIN
```

- **PLAIN repo** → one worktree, one feature branch, one PR; `gh` for the PR.
- **INTEGRATION repo** → one parent worktree spanning constituents, the spec/graph
  loop at the parent only, then fan-out to per-constituent branches + PRs
  (`propagate.sh`, `verify.sh`).

**The worktree itself is the same command in both.** `wt new` creates the
worktree *and* its Skill Manager home, and detects which repo shape it is
standing in, so this fork does not reach worktree creation — it decides the
spec/graph scope and whether there is a fan-out at the end.

## Ordinary close-out sequence

An unmarked ticket is not done when the code is green. It is done when these five
moves have all happened, in order. Every ordinary/integration agent runs this —
no exceptions, no leaving a PR "ready for someone to merge later". Epic tickets
do not run this sequence; their ticket-scoped close-out and external-review stop
are in `references/epic-ticket.md`.

1. **Close every open spec ticket, then the spec workflow, with the
   `tla-spec-dev` CLI** (installed by `spec-double-compiler`). Close each ticket
   still open in `ticket_plan.yaml` by id — not just the last one — then promote:
   ```bash
   tla-spec-dev --spec-root specs close ticket <ticket-id> --summary "<what landed>" --result <evidence-path>
   # repeat for every ticket still open
   python <spec-double-compiler-skill>/scripts/close_tickets.py --repo-root . \
     --summary "Promoted desired/current into program_model"
   ```
2. **Commit and push** the implementation, spec changes, and evidence together.
3. **Rebase and merge the PR into `main` with `gh`** — land it yourself rather
   than leaving it open for someone else to merge:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --fill --body "Closes #<n>"
   gh pr merge --rebase
   ```
   When the issue declared a goal, the PR body also carries a
   `## Goal contribution` section — one row per goal with the measured local
   signal and its classification, including "no measurable movement"
   (`references/goal-signal.md`).
4. **Close out the worktree's Skill Manager home, THEN remove the worktree, then
   sync the project root to the new `main`.** The gate runs *before* the
   removal — after it, there is nothing left to save:
   ```bash
   # 4a. One command, both repo shapes: it runs the gate and, only on a clean
   #     verdict, removes the worktree. Prefer it to spelling the two steps out —
   #     two commands on separate lines run the removal whatever the gate
   #     returned, which is exactly the loss the gate exists to prevent.
   WT="${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/skills/git-issue-workflow/scripts/wt"
   "$WT" close <ticket>

   # 4b. Only once that succeeded:
   git -C <repo-root> checkout main && git -C <repo-root> pull origin main
   git -C <repo-root> worktree prune
   ```
   Underneath, 4a is `skill-manager home close-out --home <worktree>/.skill-manager
   --into <repo-root>/.skill-manager && git worktree remove <worktree>`; run it
   that way only when you need to pass a flag `wt close` does not forward, and
   keep the `&&`. Needing a flag is the *only* reason to spell it out — reaching
   this pair because `wt close` could not be found is the reportable case above.
   Exit 0 is the only one that means "proceed". The three non-zero exits are not
   interchangeable and only the first prints blockers:
   - **1** — the worktree still holds work. Every blocking unit is named with the
     literal command that clears it. Run those, then re-run. Do not work around
     it; this is the only notice you get.
   - **2** — the path given to `--home` is not a home. Almost always: you passed
     the worktree directory instead of its `.skill-manager`. No blockers printed,
     because nothing was assessed.
   - **9** — the destination home is `frozen`, so the gate was refused and
     **nothing was attempted**. Not a verdict about your work.
   `wt close` is the same wrapper in both repo shapes (it forwards to
   `close-change.sh`, which refuses on a non-zero verdict with exit 4). Details
   and the `--force` semantics are in `references/complete.md` step 6.

   After the home gate is clean, project-home plugins may run a bounded
   `lifecycle/worktree-pre-remove` callback. A dry run invokes its read-only
   `check`; a real close invokes `release` immediately before Git removal. A
   callback failure preserves the worktree and is never bypassed by `--force`,
   because discarding home edits cannot make a leaked external binding safe.
   The stable callback contract is documented in `references/skill-homes.md`.
5. **Close the GitHub issue with `gh`.** A `Closes #<n>` merge usually closes it
   automatically — confirm that, don't assume it, and close it explicitly if not:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <n> --json state,closed
   gh issue close <n> --comment "<summary>"   # only if still open
   ```

**INTEGRATION repos** skip step 3's `gh pr merge` — the parent worktree has no
GitHub remote to merge against, so land it with `git merge --no-ff` and
`verify.sh` instead (`references/complete.md` step 5) — but still run 1, 2, 4,
and 5 at the parent, then fan out to constituents
(`references/integration-fanout.md`).

Full step-by-step, including the INTEGRATION variant of each move, lives in
`references/complete.md`; treat the list above as the checklist you're not
allowed to skip.

## Role 2 — Provision an ordinary or integration ticket

Full flow in `references/provision.md`. In short:

1. Read the issue (References, Spec-workflow section, Regression checklist). Confirm
   `gh` auth and the right repo.
2. Detect PLAIN vs INTEGRATION (above).
3. Create the worktree + `feature/<ticket>`, applying the index-base pinning
   conventions in `references/provision.md` §3 (clean tree; resolve the base
   rev to commit/tree OIDs once; create-only `refs/index-bases/*` retention
   ref; branch from the pinned commit). **One command, both repo shapes** — it
   creates the worktree and its own Skill Manager home together, which a bare
   `git worktree add` does not:
   ```bash
   WT="${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/skills/git-issue-workflow/scripts/wt"
   "$WT" new <ticket> "$commit_oid"      # prints: created worktree <path>
   ```
   `cd` to the path it printed — it is `<parent>/<repo>-<ticket>`, not
   `../wt-<ticket>`. If it exits 3 with "no project home yet", run the absolute
   `fix:` line it prints (once per repository) and re-run.
4. If the issue's Spec-workflow section is REQUIRED, open the spec workflow **now**,
   on the fresh branch: `tla-spec-dev --spec-root specs scaffold workflow <ticket>
   "<title>"` then `tla-spec-dev --spec-root specs open ticket <ticket>`. Commit the
   scaffolded `current/`/`desired/` so the branch is spec-first.

## Role 3 — Perform an ordinary or integration ticket

Full flow in `references/complete.md`; the loop is `references/validation-loop.md`.
In short:

1. Implement in the worktree. For an integration repo, edit across constituent
   files in the one parent worktree.
2. Run the **current→desired validation loop** until `specs/current` semantically
   equals `specs/desired_program_model` and every named graph is green
   (`references/validation-loop.md`). If the issue declares a goal, run its local
   signal once those are green, store it with the evidence, and classify it —
   advisory, never a gate (`references/goal-signal.md`).
3. Run the **close-out sequence** above: close every spec ticket and the workflow
   via `tla-spec-dev`, commit and push, rebase-merge the PR into `main` via `gh`,
   remove the worktree and sync the project root to the new `main`, and close the
   GitHub issue via `gh` (`references/complete.md`).
4. **INTEGRATION only:** fan out to every changed constituent — a `feature/<ticket>`
   branch, a PR, and an **agent tag** on each, so each constituent runs its own
   loops downstream (`references/integration-fanout.md`).

## Receiving an agent-tagged PR

When *this* repo is a constituent and an integration MR opened an agent-tagged PR
against it, the agent that picks up that tag runs a self-contained loop: update the
program-model specs, extend test-graph adapters/nodes if needed, run the spec-unit
/ unit / test_graph / spec-graph loop, then commit and push for review. That
receiver flow is `references/agent-tag-pr.md`.

## Boundaries

- This skill **executes** a ticket; it does not author the issue. Issue creation,
  the References section, and the spec-required decision are `git-issue`'s job.
- It does not create or amend an epic assignment. In epic mode it consumes the
  marker-delimited assignment, stops only when the PR base or branch would be
  wrong, and otherwise proceeds on the plan's values, listing any mismatch in
  the PR. `SKILL_GATES=off` lets `wt new` proceed from a dirty parent tree and
  forces the tla-spec-dev close gates; `wt close` still takes an explicit
  `--force`.
- It does not reimplement the spec, test-graph, or fan-out mechanics — it
  **sequences** them. Those live in `spec-double-compiler` (the `tla-spec-dev`
  CLI), `test-graph` (the graph scripts), and `git-integration-repo`
  (`propagate.sh`, `verify.sh` — the constituent fan-out, needed only in an
  integration repo).
- The **worktree lifecycle it does own**: `scripts/wt`, `scripts/new-change.sh`,
  `scripts/close-change.sh`, `scripts/bootstrap-home.sh`, `scripts/agent-home.sh`
  and `scripts/lib.sh` are this skill's, because a ticket and a worktree exist for every repo while an
  integration repository is a specialization that exists only when a repo has
  constituents. They used to live in `git-integration-repo`, and an agent
  working a plain repo — reading that skill's description, correctly concluding
  it was irrelevant — never learned `wt` existed and wrote its own worktree
  script instead. The dependency runs specialized → general:
  `git-integration-repo` → `git-issue-workflow` → `git-issue`.
- It never runs per-constituent specs/graphs during a ticket. Constituents
  validate themselves after fan-out, via their agent-tagged PRs.
- It does not invent goals, baselines, or targets, and it never edits one to
  match a result. Goals are agreed with the user by `git-issue` /
  `git-epic-workflow`; this skill consumes what the work order declares.
- **It does not tune to a metric.** The declared local signal is measured,
  recorded, and reported — never gated on, never re-run selectively for a better
  number, never a reason to widen scope past the ticket's slice or weaken a
  REQUIRED validation entry. Report the run that happened; where a goal turns out
  to be unreachable from this slice, that is a deferred finding for the plan
  owner, not extra work for this ticket (`references/goal-signal.md`).

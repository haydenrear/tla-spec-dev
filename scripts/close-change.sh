#
# Tear down a ticket worktree — but only after proving that removing it
# destroys nothing.
#
# This is the other half of new-change.sh. That script gives a worktree its own
# Skill Manager home so an agent cannot write the operator's global one; this
# one makes sure the work that home accumulated has somewhere to go before the
# directory is deleted.
#
# Why a script at all
# -------------------
# `git worktree remove` deletes `<wt>/.skill-manager` without asking, and it
# succeeds just as quietly whether the home held a week of skill edits or
# nothing at all. The edits are invisible to the parent diff (the home is
# gitignored, so `git add -A` never sees them and propagate.sh can never carry
# them), so the loss leaves no trace anywhere. Until now "push back before
# teardown" was a sentence in references/skill-homes.md — a discipline, not a
# mechanism. `skill-manager home close-out` answers exactly the right question
# and nothing called it.
#
# So: the gate runs BEFORE the removal, and a non-zero verdict stops the
# removal and prints each blocking unit with the command that clears it.
#
# Why --force exists
# ------------------
# Sometimes the operator really does want to discard: a spike, a worktree whose
# home was scribbled in while debugging, an experiment already published
# elsewhere. A gate with no escape hatch does not stop those people, it just
# routes them around it — `rm -rf` on the directory, or `git worktree remove
# --force` by hand, both of which skip the gate AND every other check this
# script makes. An override that is named, logged and loud is safer than one
# the operator improvises. --force therefore still RUNS the gate and still
# PRINTS the blockers; it only declines to stop. It never overrides a plugin
# lifecycle callback: discarding home edits cannot make a leaked external
# binding safe.
#
# How it degrades
# ---------------
# The rule is: proceed only when the gate has actually established that there is
# nothing to lose. Anything else refuses and points at --force.
#
#   * worktree has no home      -> ALLOW. There is provably nothing to lose;
#                                  this is the --no-home case new-change.sh
#                                  supports on purpose.
#   * no CLI with `close-out`   -> REFUSE. Cannot establish safety. A gate that
#                                  opens when it cannot check is not a gate.
#   * project home missing      -> REFUSE. Same reason: nowhere to check against.
#   * gate says blocked         -> REFUSE, and print the remedies.
#
# Note the asymmetry is deliberate: "no home" is a proof of safety, while "no
# tool" and "no destination" are absences of proof, and those are not the same
# thing.

  TICKET           Ticket id; the worktree is <parent-dir>/<repo>-<TICKET>,
                   the same path new-change.sh creates. If that path is not
                   there, the ticket is resolved against the worktrees that
                   ARE — so this runs from any directory, not only from the
                   repo that opened the worktree. Ambiguity is named, never
                   guessed. A path may be given instead.
  --into HOME      Project home the worktree's work must reach first.
                   Default: the project home the worktree's own home was cloned
                   FROM — <main working tree>/.skill-manager. bootstrap-home.sh
                   derives the clone source from the same function, so the two
                   agree by construction rather than by exported variable.
  --force          Remove even if the gate refuses. The gate still runs and its
                   blockers are still printed; the work is DISCARDED.
  --dry-run        Run the gate and report; remove nothing.

# all, and the teardown would sail past a gate that never ran. So read the help
# TEXT and require an option only the real subcommand documents.
#
# Search order puts the worktree's OWN bin/cli first: that slot names the build
# the home was created with, which is the build that understands its layout.
# That preference is right and is kept — but since #61 that slot holds a shim
# that resolves ITSELF through $SKILL_MANAGER_CLI, so every invocation of a
# chosen CLI goes through `run_cli` below, probes included. The probe is not
# exempt: the variable can already be set in the caller's environment, and then
# the hang happens here, before the `cli:` line is ever printed.

# also puts first on an agent session's PATH — resolves its own target as
#
#   cli="${SKILL_MANAGER_CLI:-<absolute path of the build that pinned it>}"
#   …
#   exec "$cli" "$@"
#
# It already knows its absolute target; that is the whole point of a pin. Naming
# the pin in that variable REPLACES the target with a path to itself, and it
# re-execs forever. Measured on the epic #2 pilot: 7:03 of CPU over 13:06 of
# wall clock, from one teardown. It hangs rather than failing, so on a fan-out
# it is indistinguishable from slow work.
#
# Two predicates, because each covers the other's blind spot:
#
#   * the home's own pin SLOT, by path. That file's identity is "the CLI for
#     this home", so pointing the variable at it is never what we mean — and
#     this answer survives an unreadable file, a stripped comment header, or any
#     future rewrite of the generated body.
#   * any candidate whose bytes EXPAND the variable. That is the one that
#     catches the PATH candidate: inside an agent session `command -v
#     skill-manager` is some OTHER home's pin, whose path this script has no
#     reason to recognise.
#
# Matched as FIXED strings, for the same reason bootstrap-home.sh matches
# GENERATED_PIN_PREFIX that way: `${`, `:-` and `$` are each metacharacters in
# some dialect of some grep, and a pattern that quietly matches nothing here
# means the check never fires. Matched on an EXPANSION (`${NAME` / `$NAME`)
# rather than on the bare name, so a shim that merely mentions the variable in a
# diagnostic — as the generated pin's own error message does — is not caught by
# that mention alone.
#
# This deliberately does not lean on skill-manager's companion self-exec guard.
# The homes most likely to be torn down are the ones pinned by the build that

# Plugins may own external state whose lifetime is the worktree's lifetime. A
# home diff cannot see that state, so the close-out gate above cannot release or
# validate it. Project-home plugins may therefore provide one executable at:
#
#   <project-home>/plugins/<plugin>/lifecycle/worktree-pre-remove
#
# The project home is the authority deliberately: it survives removal, covers
# --no-home worktrees, and has already received any clean worktree-home changes
# through the gate. Callbacks are stable-name ordered, bounded to 30 seconds,
# and get only paths plus the operation. Each plugin owns how it reads its own
# config beneath --project-home.
#
# `check` is read-only and runs for --dry-run. `release` runs after every local
# refusal (including "standing in the target") has passed and immediately
# before git removes the worktree. A non-zero result always refuses, including
# with --force: that flag may discard home bytes, but it may not silently leak
# an external binding.

# THE LAST MILE, WHICH THIS TEARDOWN USED TO LEAVE UNSAID.
#
# The gate above is about whether removing the worktree would DESTROY work, and
# the remedy it names is `home sync`. What `home sync` does is move an edit ONE
# TIER UP — from `<worktree>/.skill-manager` into this checkout's own project
# home — and that is the whole of it. Two fresh-agent evals noticed the gap
# unprompted, from opposite directions: the edit is not in the skill's own
# repository, so a later reinstall or upgrade of that unit overwrites it and no
# other checkout ever sees it; and the push cannot be done from the worktree
# anyway, because the copy of the skill that holds the edit is inside a home
# that is being deleted in the same breath.
#
# So the successful close states where the work now is and what it still owes.
# A key, not a paragraph on stderr: the removal is exactly the moment the
# obligation becomes invisible — the home is gone and the loss appears in no
# diff — and `wt` carries it onto its one line for the same reason. See
# git-integration-skill#8.
[ "$HAD_HOME" = 0 ] || contract HOME-WORK \
  "$INTO (as far as \`home sync\` moves it — this checkout only. A skill edit is not in that skill's OWN repository until it is pushed from $ROOT, and until then a reinstall can overwrite it and no other checkout sees it.)"

cat >&2 <<EOF

The branch is still here. Delete it when the change has landed:
  git -C "$ROOT" branch -d ${WT_BRANCH:-<branch>}

[ "$HAD_HOME" = 0 ] || cat >&2 <<EOF

Where this worktree's HOME work now lives, and what it still owes:
  $INTO
That is one tier up, and one tier only. \`skill-manager home sync\` reconciles a
worktree home into the checkout's own home; it does NOT push a skill edit back
to that skill's repository, and \`propagate.sh\` does not either — propagate
fans out the PARENT's tracked files, and a home is gitignored.
So if you edited a skill in that worktree:
  * the edit is now in $INTO and nowhere else,
  * a later \`skill-manager install\`/\`upgrade\`/\`sync\` of that unit can
    overwrite it, and no other checkout will ever see it,
  * push it from $ROOT — not from a worktree, whose copy of the skill lived in
    the home that has just been deleted.

# new-change.sh <TICKET> [base-branch] [--integration] [--no-home] [--stale-base-ok]
#
# Create a ticketed worktree, with its own Skill Manager home, for the repo you
# are standing in.
#
# Which repo that is
# ------------------
# The nearest enclosing git toplevel — and the script SAYS which one before it
# does anything. It used to resolve the nearest ancestor holding
# integration.toml instead (repo_root), which is right for propagate/refresh/
# verify and wrong here: a constituent has its own real .git, so run from
# constituents/deploy-helm that answer was the integration PARENT, and the
# script branched and worktree'd a different repository than the one the
# operator was standing in — with exit 0 and no warning. Three shapes now, all
# supported, all announced:
#
#   integration   the checkout holds integration.toml. Constituent files are
#                 plain files in the worktree; propagate.sh fans the change out
#                 afterwards. (Includes a NESTED integration repo such as
#                 meta-orchestrator, which is an integration repo in its own
#                 right and correct to branch here.)
#   constituent   a git repo living inside an integration repo's tree. Branch
#                 the constituent itself. Nothing to fan out; the integration
#                 parent refreshes its snapshot after the change merges.
#   standalone    an ordinary repo, outside any integration repo.
#
# Supporting all three rather than refusing two of them is deliberate. The
# script's value is that the per-worktree home is not optional; sending an
# operator to `git worktree add` + `bootstrap-home.sh` by hand makes the home
# step something to remember again, which is the exact failure the home exists
# to prevent. What must never happen is a SILENT wrong target, and that is
# fixed by resolving correctly and printing the answer, not by refusing.
#
# Pass --integration to target the enclosing integration repo instead of the
# constituent you happen to be standing in.
#
# Where the worktree goes
# -----------------------
# Beside the OUTERMOST enclosing integration repo — see worktree_parent_dir in
# lib.sh. Unchanged for a top-level repo; for anything inside an integration
# repo it is the difference between a clean parent and a parent whose
# `git add -A` stages the worktree as a gitlink.
#
# The home
# --------
# The worktree gets its OWN Skill Manager home (bootstrap-home.sh) before this
# script returns, and therefore before any agent can run in it. That is on
# purpose: an agent that has to remember to export SKILL_MANAGER_HOME will
# sometimes not, and the failure is invisible — it just edits the operator's
# global home instead. Pass --no-home (or INTEGRATION_SKIP_HOME=1) only when
# you know the worktree will never host an agent.
#
# The branch POINT
# ----------------
# `git worktree add -b <branch> <path> <base>` resolves a bare `<base>` to the
# LOCAL ref, and this script never fetched, so it branched from whatever the
# local ref happened to say. In an epic whose ticket PRs are merged SERVER-SIDE
# (`gh pr merge`), `origin/epic/<slug>` advances and the local `epic/<slug>`
# never does — measured: a ticket branched 21 commits behind origin and noticed
# only because it compared its own HEAD against a SHA written into its work
# order. Nothing in the run said anything.
#
# So the branch point is now MEASURED before the worktree is created (see "the
# branch point is not stale" below): if the base has a remote counterpart and
# the local ref is BEHIND it, the run refuses and names the remedy. It is not
# silently redirected to origin/<base> — branching from a deliberately local
# state is legitimate — and --stale-base-ok is the one flag that says so.

usage: new-change.sh <TICKET> [base-branch] [--integration] [--no-home]
                     [--stale-base-ok]

  TICKET          Ticket id. The branch is feature/<TICKET>; the worktree is
                  <repo>-<TICKET>, placed beside the outermost enclosing
                  integration repo.
  base-branch     Branch to start from. Default: the checkout's current branch.
                  A bare name is the LOCAL ref; see --stale-base-ok.
  --integration   Target the enclosing INTEGRATION repo rather than the
                  constituent you are standing in.
  --no-home       Skip the per-worktree Skill Manager home. Agents launched in
                  the worktree then use the operator's global home.
  --stale-base-ok Branch from the local base even when it is BEHIND its remote
                  counterpart. Without it that is a refusal, because a bare base
                  name resolves to the local ref and a base that trails
                  origin/<base> produces a worktree of a superseded tree with no
                  signal at all.
  --quiet         Print nothing at all on stderr. The contract on stdout is
                  unaffected — it is what `wt` shows.
  --verbose       Put the whole log on stderr as it happens, instead of the one
                  line naming it.
  --info          Print the contract for a worktree that ALREADY exists, and
                  create nothing. `wt info <TICKET>` is this.
  --log FILE      Write the narration to FILE instead of a fresh temp file. The
                  file is created if absent and APPENDED to, so a caller that
                  wants to tail the run can name a path before starting it —
                  which is what `wt` does.
  -h, --help      This message.

HOW LONG IT TAKES. Almost all of it is the Skill Manager home, and the cost
scales with the SOURCE HOME, not with the repo. Measured on this machine
against an 18-unit / 852 MB project home: 48 s, of which ~34 s is
`skill-manager home clone` (28.7 s of that copying 40307 files) and ~14 s is
the eight further CLI starts. A 1-unit home is a few seconds. It was 152 s
before the descriptor read was hoisted out of the per-unit loops. Nothing is
printed until it finishes, so if you expect to wait: pass --verbose, or tail
the file --log names.

THE BASE IS REFRESHED FIRST, and it is ONE REF. Before the worktree is created
this fetches exactly `+refs/heads/<base>:refs/remotes/<remote>/<base>` from the
base's own remote — no tags, no other branch — and refuses if the local base is
then behind it. WT_FETCH=0 skips the fetch and compares against the
remote-tracking ref as it already stands (offline; and it is what the epic case
misses, since nothing else advances that ref). WT_FETCH_TIMEOUT (default 10 s)
bounds a stalled transfer.

Stdout is the contract and nothing else: WORKTREE / BRANCH / BASE / LAUNCH /
IF-EXIT-8 / CLOSE (/ PROPAGATE, / STALE-BASE) on success, FAILED / FIX on
failure. BASE is on the creating run only — `--info` measured no branch point —
and STALE-BASE only when --stale-base-ok was used. Stderr on a
successful run is one line: the log file holding the narration, this script's
and bootstrap-home.sh's alike. `wt new <TICKET>` runs this and prints a ONE-LINE
summary of the contract instead; `wt info <TICKET>` prints the contract itself.

#
# Same shape as bootstrap-home.sh's, and for the same measured reason: 44 lines
# / 4.0 KB on a successful run, of which 28 were a prose restatement of the five
# contract lines already on stdout. The contract is the output; the prose is the
# explanation of it, and an explanation belongs where it can be read when it is
# wanted rather than paid for when it is not.
#
# fd 2 becomes the log, so this script's narration, its closing notes AND every
# byte bootstrap-home.sh writes land in ONE file — which is the point: a worktree
# provisioning is one story, and it used to be told in two places. fd 3 is the
# operator's real stderr and carries one line.
#
# --quiet is unchanged in meaning and is what `wt` passes: nothing on stderr at
# all, because `wt` prints its own contract and captures this one.
#
# --log names it instead. That is what makes a run WATCHABLE: this script prints
# nothing until it is finished — the contract is emitted atomically at the end —
# and on a large source home it runs for the best part of a minute, which is
# long enough that a caller under a foreground timeout has to background it and
# then poll. Polling an agent's own transcript re-sends the whole transcript
# every time; `tail -f` on a named file does not. So the caller is allowed to
# choose the file BEFORE the run starts, and `wt` does exactly that.
#
# Appended, never truncated: the path may be one the caller has already told
# somebody to watch, and truncating it under a live `tail -f` loses the head of
# the story for no gain.

#
# STDOUT, and nothing else on it. These are the facts an agent needs to take its
# next step, and they are emitted HERE rather than assembled by `wt` afterwards
# because this script is the only thing that authoritatively knows them: $WT came
# from `ticket_worktree_path`, which is the same function close-change.sh
# resolves the ticket with, and $ROOT/$KIND came from the resolution this script
# already printed. A front door that re-derived them would be a second opinion
# about which worktree belongs to which repo, and issue #50 is what a second
# opinion about that costs.
#
# ONE function, called from the creating path and from `--info`, because those
# two answer the same question about the same worktree and a second copy is a
# second chance to disagree. `wt new` prints a one-line summary OF THIS, and
# `wt info` prints THIS; neither assembles it.
#
# The LAUNCH branch keys on whether the home is THERE, not on whether --no-home
# was passed. The two coincide on the creating path; on `--info` only the first
# is knowable, and it is the one that is true — printing a shim that does not
# exist is the same class of defect as `verified` over an empty home.
# THE ONE PLACE THIS GENERAL SCRIPT REACHES INTO THE SPECIALIZED SKILL.
#
# `PROPAGATE` is the only integration-repo fact in this file's contract, and the
# fan-out it names is shipped by `git-integration-repo` — the skill that depends
# on this one, not the other way round. So it is RESOLVED rather than assumed,
# and it is resolved the same way every other cross-unit path in these skills is:
# an installed unit's files live at `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/skills/<unit>/`, with
# the `:-` fallback that makes it work from a bare shell.
#
# The second rung is anchored on the INTEGRATION ROOT — the target — and not on
# this script's own location. That distinction is the rule selftest.sh asserts:
# a path relative to where this file happens to sit is evidence about the
# checkout, not about which copy should run, and it is how a stale sibling clone
# gets executed. `$INTEGRATION/constituents/git-integration-repo` is a fact
# about the repo being branched.
#
# When neither answers, the key is still a COMMAND THAT RUNS — the install — and
# not a path that does not exist. An integration repo whose home lacks the unit
# has a real next move, and printing a dead path would be the `<placeholder>`
# defect in a different costume.

# lib.sh or bootstrap-home.sh. So the worktree started wherever the local ref
# happened to be, which is fine right up until something else is advancing the
# branch. In an epic whose ticket PRs are merged server-side, that is the normal
# case: `gh pr merge` moves `origin/epic/<slug>` and nothing moves the local
# `epic/<slug>` or even the local COPY of the remote one. Measured: a ticket
# branched 21 commits behind and caught it only by comparing HEAD against a SHA
# in its work order. Had it not, it would have edited a superseded file and
# reported a true sentence about the wrong tree.
#
# WHAT IS REFUSED, AND WHAT IS NOT. Not "the base is not origin/<base>" — a
# deliberately local branch point is a legitimate thing to want, and silently
# redirecting to the remote would break it without a word, which is the same
# class of defect in the other direction. What is refused is the base being
# BEHIND its own remote counterpart, which is never something anyone chose. A
# base that is AHEAD, EQUAL, or has no counterpart at all is untouched.
#
# WHY IT FETCHES, given that `new` runs constantly. Because without one the
# check is close to vacuous for the case that motivated it: `refs/remotes/origin/
# <base>` is a LOCAL CACHE, advanced only by a fetch, so a repo that has not
# fetched since the server-side merge compares the stale local ref against an
# equally stale copy of the remote and finds them identical. The cost is one ref
# from one remote, `--no-tags`, no working-tree effect: measured on this machine
# against GitHub over HTTPS, 0.17-0.22 s on this skill's own repo and 0.48-0.86 s
# on a larger one — against a command whose OTHER half copies a Skill Manager
# home for 48 s (see "HOW LONG IT TAKES" above). It is around 1% of the run and
# the cheapest thing in it. WT_FETCH=0 removes it for anyone offline or on a slow
# link, at the cost stated in the usage.
#
# It cannot HANG, which is the one way a constant-cost command turns unbounded.
# Auth prompts are the realistic cause and both are shut off (GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT
# / BatchMode); a stalled transfer is bounded by git's own low-speed abort rather
# than by killing the process, because a SIGKILLed fetch can leave a ref lock
# behind and the remedy for that would be worse than the problem.

The home was cloned and held units, but they were not linked into the worktree's
agent homes, so an agent started there would have seen NONE of them. That used
to be reported as \`verified\` and exit 0. bootstrap-home.sh named the exact
missing links and the \`sync --skip-mcp\` that creates them, above.

No home could be created for this worktree, so an agent started in it would
read and write the operator's GLOBAL home. The cause is printed above, and the

re-running, through the gate rather than by hand:

Edit in:
  $WT
Launch an agent bound to this worktree's own home:
  $WT/.skill-manager/bin/launch/claude
If that first launch is REFUSED with exit 8, the home is fine — its units
changed and skill-manager gates the next launch until the change has been read.
Read it and clear it, through this home's own CLI entrypoint:
  $WT/.skill-manager/bin/cli/skill-manager home drift
  $WT/.skill-manager/bin/cli/skill-manager home drift --ack
Then commit and bring it back:
  git -C "$WT" add -A && git -C "$WT" commit -m "$TICKET: <what changed>"
  git -C "$ROOT" merge --no-ff "$BRANCH"
Close the worktree through the gate (NOT a bare "git worktree remove"):

EOF

if [ "$KIND" = integration ]; then
  cat >&2 <<EOF
Finally fan it out to the constituents (git-integration-repo ships this; the
line below is resolved, so it runs as printed):
  $(propagate_command "$TICKET")
EOF
else
  cat >&2 <<EOF

This is a $KIND worktree, so propagate.sh does NOT apply — there are no
constituents beneath it to fan out to. Once the change has merged here, refresh
the integration parent's snapshot of this repo from the parent's own main tree.
EOF
fi

cat >&2 <<EOF

Teardown note: the home lives inside the worktree, so removing the worktree
removes the home, and because the home is gitignored that loss appears in no
diff. close-change.sh runs "skill-manager home close-out" first and refuses
while the home still holds unit work, naming each blocker and its remedy; pass
--force to discard deliberately. See references/skill-homes.md. Reconciling
into the project home is NOT the same as pushing a skill edit back to that
skill's own repo — that is the separate push-back flow, and it is not
propagate.sh.

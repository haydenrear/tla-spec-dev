# it is a script because the two files must agree: skill-manager warns on drift
# and the harness silently prefers one, so a hand-edit of either alone surfaces
# later as an inexplicable version on a consumer's machine.
#
# It does not commit, tag, or push. A version bump belongs to the change that
# earned it — usually the same commit — and pushing is outward-facing.

"""Scaffold a standalone tutorial/example spec-double project.

This is the TUTORIAL path. It creates a small, self-contained spec whose
manifest drives the spec-double codegen in ``scripts/generate_python.py``.

For onboarding a real repository, use ``tla-spec-dev scaffold project``
instead, which creates ``specs/program_model`` as the accepted baseline.

Both paths emit the SAME baseline shape, because there is only one accepted
shape: Core.tla + Internal.tla/.cfg + External.tla/.cfg + actions.yml +
adapters.py + providers.py + case_adapters.toml + testgraph_bindings.yml. A single-module spec
with no External view cannot generate Test Graph cases, so it can never be
validated against its public surface. See references/testgraph_adapters.md.

While a spec workflow is open, the active desired overlays DesiredCore.tla,
DesiredInternal.tla, and DesiredExternal.tla sit alongside the baseline. They
are promoted into the baseline and deleted at closeout; an accepted, closed
model must not retain them.

# Emitted verbatim into every scaffolded module that imports
# ``spec_double_compiler`` (adapters.py, providers.py).
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. `tla-spec-dev` puts the installed skill on PYTHONPATH before it
# runs anything, so under the CLI the plain import already works. A Test Graph
# node, a bare `pytest`, or an IDE imports these modules WITHOUT that env, and
# the scaffold used to emit a bare `from spec_double_compiler.runtime import ...`
# that then died on ModuleNotFoundError. Every repository onboarded so far
# hand-patched that the same way, and every one of them wrote
# ``Path.home() / ".skill-manager"`` as the fallback.
#
# WHY `Path.home()` IS LAST. A checkout can have its own Skill Manager home:
# `<repo>/.skill-manager` for a project, `<worktree>/.skill-manager` for a ticket
# worktree. Those are real copies, not links, precisely so two worktrees do not
# edit each other's units. A fallback that reaches `~/.skill-manager` first
# silently reads a DIFFERENT build of this skill than the one the checkout was
# resolved against — and, from a worktree, one that another agent is editing
# right now. So: the explicit override, then the bound home, then the nearest
# enclosing checkout home, and only then the operator's global home.
#
# An explicit-but-wrong `SPEC_DOUBLE_COMPILER_HOME` REFUSES rather than falling
# through. Falling through would answer "which skill did I load?" with the global
# home while the operator believes they redirected it — the fail-open shape this
# resolution order exists to remove.
#
# WHY THE RESOLUTION IS NOT INSIDE `except ModuleNotFoundError`. It was, and that
# made every guarantee above conditional on the module NOT already being
# importable — including under `tla-spec-dev`, the one caller the comment names.
# Measured with both homes planted: `PYTHONPATH=<operator home>` plus
# `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME=<project home>` plus an explicit-but-WRONG
# `SPEC_DOUBLE_COMPILER_HOME` resolved the operator's global home, exit 0, empty
# stderr. Both documented properties were void, and the tests could not see it
# because they stripped PYTHONPATH unconditionally — a one-sided assertion of
# exactly the shape that let epic #1's always-127 CLI shim pass for weeks.
#
# So the resolver runs unconditionally and an inherited `PYTHONPATH` answers only
# when none of the four candidates does. The consequence worth knowing: when
# `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` and the CLI on PATH name DIFFERENT builds of this skill,
# the bound home wins. That is the intended direction — the home a checkout is
# bound to is the authority, and `SPEC_DOUBLE_COMPILER_HOME` is the override for
# when it is not.

A standalone example spec-double project. For onboarding a real repository use
`tla-spec-dev scaffold project` instead.

This uses the one accepted baseline shape. It is not complete until it has:

- `Core.tla` — shared constants and operators
- `Internal.tla` / `Internal.cfg` — internal view -> spec-unit cases
- `External.tla` / `External.cfg` — external view -> Test Graph cases
- `actions.yml` — per-action layer, controllability, what it generates
- `adapters.py` — spec-unit adapters AND Test Graph adapters/projector/assertion
- `providers.py` — agent-authored generated-port effect providers
- `effect_provider_usage.yaml` — provider state, fuzz, assertion, and bypass evidence
- `case_adapters.toml` — internal action -> spec-unit adapter
- `testgraph_bindings.yml` — external action -> Test Graph adapter
- `tlc_projection.py` — TLC state -> generated-case shapes
- `spec_manifest.yaml` — ports, invariants, finite model, codegen config

Test Graph adapters are foundational to every project. Without the External
view and its adapters, the public surface is never validated.

`Desired*.tla` are active overlays for an open spec workflow. Promote them into
the baseline and delete them at closeout.

Validate both views:

```bash
scripts/run_tlc.sh Internal.tla Internal.cfg
scripts/run_tlc.sh External.tla External.cfg

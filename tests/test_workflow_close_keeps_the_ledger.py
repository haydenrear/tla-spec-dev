"""Workflow close must not take the cumulative findings ledger with it.

THE SUBJECT IS THIS REPOSITORY, NOT A FIXTURE. Every test here copies the real
`specs/current`, `specs/desired_program_model`, `specs/program_model`, the real
`specs/.history/cut-the-apparatus-epic` receipts and the real
`specs/results/*` inputs into a throwaway directory and runs the real
`close_tickets.close_ticket_workflow` over them. A hand-built two-file spec tree
would not have reproduced either defect: both are about what the shipped close
does to the 267-row ledger this project actually carries.

WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE THE FIX (a real close, run and observed, not read off
the source):

  - The close DOES archive the ledger. `snapshot_models` copies all three model
    directories into `<entry>/snapshots/`, `copy_ignore` does NOT filter
    `deferred_findings.yaml` (it is not in `IGNORED_COPY_NAMES`), and the file
    landed complete -- all 267 rows -- at
    `closed-snapshot/snapshots/desired_program_model/deferred_findings.yaml`.
    The reports that the archive step was missing, and that `copy_ignore` was
    eating the file, were both WRONG.

  - The five closed-snapshots already in `specs/.history` lack the ledger
    because they PREDATE it living at that path, not because a close dropped it.
    The current ledger file was added at `e6d1351` (2026-08-05 13:25); the
    newest of the five, `hexagonal-prompting-epic`, was written 2026-08-05
    11:29.

  - What was actually broken is the READ. `scripts/disposition.py` addresses the
    ledger only at its live path, the close removes the directory containing it,
    and so `disposition.py --epic cut-the-apparatus` died with a bare
    `FileNotFoundError` traceback the moment the epic it reports on was closed.
    The record survived; nothing could reach it.

So the fix is an ADDRESS and a FALLBACK, never an exemption: the close still
removes `desired_program_model/`. `spec_evolution.snapshot_findings_ledger`
writes the ledger at the top of the history entry and names it in the manifest
under `findings_ledger`; `disposition.resolve_ledger` reads that archive when
the live path is gone, and says which copy it read.

The third test covers `SF-305` in `scripts/complexity_ledger.py`: a substring
test for the template sentinel over free prose, which blanked any narrative
merely QUOTING the word `TODO` and then refused the close for a narrative that
was `absent`.

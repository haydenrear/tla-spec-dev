"""A gate states its verdict as data, so nothing has to match on a sentence.

**41 of the instrument registry's 103 demonstration slots assert on literal
output strings.** `corpus_diagnostics.py` moved from *"Every component is within
cap"* to *"Every {scope} is within cap"* when the cap became per-action, and a
demonstration that had been correct for months began reporting a working
instrument broken. Nobody wrote anything false; the coupling was a sentence.

The prose stays -- the sentence a person reads when a gate refuses is some of
this project's best work, and `#301`'s remedy text is a finding in its own
right. What changes is that **no automated consumer reads it.**

Scope, stated honestly: converting `corpus-diagnostics` fixed exactly one
standing failure. The other instruments still red are red for reasons a schema
cannot touch -- two call a script `CA-04` deleted, two are DELIBERATELY red over
a standing `R-H1` violation and say so in the file, one asserts pytest counts.
**This change is preventive, not curative**: it decouples 41 slots from wording
so the next rename does not manufacture a failure, and it fixed one that
already had.

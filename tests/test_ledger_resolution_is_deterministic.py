"""Which archived ledger you read must not depend on when you checked out.

`specs/desired_program_model/deferred_findings.yaml` is removed by a workflow
close, so both `scripts/disposition.py` and `examples/validation/scorecards/
score_tools.py` fall back to the archived copies under `specs/.history`. Both
ordered them by `(mtime, size, path)`.

Git does not preserve mtimes. So two checkouts of the SAME COMMIT resolved
different ledgers -- silently, because both answers are a real ledger:

    fresh extract of main : cut-the-apparatus-epic/closed-snapshot  (296 rows)
    working tree, same content: subtract-to-measure/ticket-005-SM-05 ( 88 rows)

Downstream, nine scorecard claims failed to resolve `filed_as = CL-03-DF-04`,
and five disposition tests asserted `88 > 200`. Those five were recorded as a
standing baseline waiting on #296 for an entire epic. They were waiting on a
`stat()` call.

`disposition.archived_ledgers`'s own docstring named the hazard -- "a
`git checkout` flattens mtimes, which is exactly when the tie-break is needed"
-- and sorted on mtime first anyway, so the size tie-break only applied to
files sharing a timestamp to the microsecond and in practice never ran.

"""`CA-06-DF-02`, consumed as an adapter conformance case (`CA-07`).

**The defect, filed by `CA-06` and confirmed by its reviewer.** The negative
corpus keyed each case's ``params`` by the TLA+ FORMAL parameter names, while
the positive corpus keys them by the names the module DECLARES in its own
action marker -- the names every shipped adapter reads. Over a full TLC state
graph the generator emits 11 negative cases for
``examples/distributed_history`` and all 11 died before asserting anything:
``KeyError: 'account'`` x7, ``KeyError: 'order'`` x4. The measured yield of
``--negative-cases`` on a real subject was zero cases EXECUTED.

**THIS FILE BUILDS AT TWO STATES, NOT THE WHOLE GRAPH, SO IT EMITS 9 AND NOT
11** -- ``KeyError: 'account'`` x7, ``KeyError: 'order'`` x2. Both figures are
real and they are not the same measurement; the 11 is the sealed pipeline run
in ``specs/results/scorecards/cut-the-apparatus/CA-07/`` and the 9 is what the
two commands in that directory's ``RESULTS.md`` reproduce. The two states are
enough because they reach all four negated actions and all four refusal
reasons; they are not enough to reproduce a count.

**The subject is real, not a fixture (`R1`).** Everything below is
``examples/distributed_history`` -- this repository's own worked example: its
``Internal.tla``, its ``Internal.cfg`` constants, the corpus already committed
under ``specs/generated/``, its ``case_adapters.toml`` mapping, and the adapter
classes that mapping names.

**Why a CONFORMANCE case and not a generator unit test.** The defect is a
disagreement between two artifacts -- what the corpus emits and what the
adapter reads -- and only one of them lives in ``scripts/``. A test of the
generator alone is green on either keying, because either keying is
self-consistent. That is how this survived three epics.

**WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT COVER, found by the independent reviewer of PR #269
and stated here rather than in a document nobody reads next to the code.**
`CA-06-DF-02` has a SECOND face: the same key mismatch made
``negative_cases_for_corpus``'s soundness cross-check compare declared names
against formal ones, so it examined nothing on any model that declares a
marker. `CA-07` repaired that too -- and **NOTHING BELOW PROTECTS THE REPAIR.**
Every call here passes ``edges=[]``, so the cross-check loop is empty by
construction; the reviewer deleted the 11-line remap and this file still
reported 5 passed. Roughly a third of `CA-07`'s production delta is therefore
evidenced by a TRANSCRIPT and not by an executable check. Filed as
`CA-07-DF-05`. Covering it needs dump ``edges`` whose after-states carry a
populated action marker, which is the one thing two hand-written states cannot
supply without transcribing a third.

**The one transcribed input** is the pair of states the cases are built at:
TLC is the only thing that produces a state graph and a unit test may not run
it. Both are the model's own -- ``Internal.tla``'s ``InternalInit`` and the
state one ``CreateAccount`` later -- and
``test_the_states_carry_exactly_the_modules_variables`` fails if the module's
variables move underneath them. Nothing else here is typed rather than read:
the argument names on both sides come out of checked-in artifacts.

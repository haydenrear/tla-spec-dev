"""A committed driver whose default `--out` the toolchain refuses is unrunnable.

E-02, round 2 of the agent-ergonomics evaluation. `#301` made
``resolve_spec_tree_out`` refuse any generated-case root outside a ``specs/``
directory, because the ``spec_tree`` effect port declares target ``**/specs/**``
and a write anywhere else is an undeclared effect. That refusal was correct.

What it also did was break
``examples/distributed_history/scripts/regenerate_tlc_cases.py``, whose default
was ``test_graph/build/generated`` -- chosen deliberately, as its own VAL-09
comment records, precisely *because* the corpus lived outside the spec tree.
The example's committed regeneration path could not run as written.

**Nothing went red**, and the reason is the point: the driver is a committed
script with no caller. The suite never invokes it. This is the second finding of
that exact shape -- the ``history-archive-excludes`` defect shipped with two
green tests because both called the helper directly and neither called the path
that used it.

So this test does not run the drivers. It asserts the one property whose absence
made them unrunnable: **a driver's default output root must be a path the
toolchain's own resolver accepts.** Running them needs TLC and minutes; the
contract needs neither, and it is the contract that broke.

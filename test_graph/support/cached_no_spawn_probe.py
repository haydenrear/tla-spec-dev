"""In-process probe: `skt check --cached` must cost ONE state-file read.

Run as `<pinned-python> cached_no_spawn_probe.py <repo-root> <workdir> <out.json>`.
Stdlib only, no testgraphsdk — it must run on a bare pinned interpreter.

WHY THIS IS A PROBE AND NOT AN ASSERTION ABOUT A SUBPROCESS
-----------------------------------------------------------
`hooks/hooks.json` gives the PostToolUse hook a 2-second timeout, and
that hook runs on EVERY tool call. "Fast enough when I measured it" is
not the contract; "spawns nothing" is. A wall-clock assertion on a
subprocess would pass on a quiet laptop and fail on a loaded runner
while measuring neither.

So the check runs INSIDE this interpreter with two independent
instruments, and both must agree:

  1. `sys.addaudithook` — CPython raises `subprocess.Popen`, `os.system`,
     `os.exec`, `os.fork`, `os.posix_spawn` and `os.spawn` from the C
     layer, so a spawn is caught no matter which module reaches it, and
     `open` is raised for every file the code opens. This is the
     instrument that cannot be routed around.
  2. Poisoned callables — `subprocess.*`, `os.fork`/`spawn*`/`system`,
     `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `threading.Thread` are replaced after
     import, so a regression produces a NAMED failure rather than a
     count. `check.run` swallows every exception by design (a traceback
     inside an agent session is worse than a bad answer), which is
     precisely why the audit hook is the primary instrument: a poisoned
     call that `run` catches still leaves its audit record.

Five cache states are driven, plus the two that share an answer:
no-home, missing, corrupt, expired, fresh-quiet, fresh-notify. All of
them read the state file at most once and none of them writes it.

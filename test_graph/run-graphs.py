"""Run this repository's behavioural test graphs — one command, one table.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
`tla-spec-dev` registers three graphs in `test_graph/build.gradle.kts`. This
script is the single front door that runs the ones meant to run here, and says
what it did NOT run and why. Every graph is reported as one of:

    RUN      executed here, verdict read from its own report
    OPT-IN   deliberately not run by default, with the opt-in command printed
    DEAD     registered but known not to work; nobody should expect it

REPORTS, NOT EXIT CODES
-----------------------
A graph's verdict is read from `build/validation-reports/<runId>/summary.json`
written by that run, never inferred from the runner's exit code. A run dir that
predates this invocation is ignored on purpose: `build/validation-reports/`
keeps passing reports from earlier runs, so a graph that never executed looks
green there. No fresh report for a graph means UNDECIDED, which is neither
green nor a failure.

WHY IT MATERIALISES BINDINGS FIRST
----------------------------------
`test_graph/settings.gradle.kts` line 2 declares `includeBuild("build-logic")`,
and `build-logic`, `sdk` and `standard-nodes` are MANAGED PROVIDER BINDINGS:
generated symlinks, gitignored (`test_graph/.gitignore`), with
`test_graph/provider-bindings.json` as the committed durable record. They were
untracked deliberately in 175f5c7c — as tracked symlinks their blobs held one
developer's absolute home path and were dangling in every other checkout.
So a FRESH WORKTREE has no `build-logic`, and a bare `cd test_graph &&
./gradlew specWorkflow` fails at configuration time in ~2s with "Included build
'.../build-logic' does not exist" (SI-12-DF-05 measured exactly this).

The test-graph skill's own runner already materialises the bindings —
`run_gradle()` in `scripts/_common.py` calls `prepare_provider_bindings_or_warn`
before invoking Gradle — so the graphs DO run in a fresh worktree when invoked
through the skill, and only fail when Gradle is invoked directly. This script
materialises the bindings explicitly anyway, and prints the result, so the step
is visible rather than a side effect somebody has to know about.

THIS SCRIPT NEVER REFUSES. It always exits 0. It is a reporting front door, not
a gate; a red or undecided graph is printed, not turned into a stop.

Usage:
    python3 test_graph/run-graphs.py            # materialise, run the RUN set, report
    python3 test_graph/run-graphs.py --list     # classification only; run nothing
    python3 test_graph/run-graphs.py --only cliWorkflow [--only ...]

# They are OPT-IN rather than RUN so the default front door stays offline and
# cannot hang on a network fetch; they are NOT dead, and they are not silently

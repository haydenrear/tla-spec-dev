"""FI-02. Run every shipped instrument against a DEMONSTRATED FAILING INPUT.

    python3 examples/validation/instruments/demonstrate.py

    python3 examples/validation/instruments/demonstrate.py --only corpus-runner
    python3 examples/validation/instruments/demonstrate.py --format json --out FILE

`references/architecture_advice.md` **S2**: *"Every criterion must have a
demonstrated failing input and a demonstrated passing input."* It was written
for a scanner that has since been deleted, and until FI-01 it had never been
turned on an instrument this repository kept. FI-01 turned it on one -- the
control-property probe -- and the result justified the epic: against the parent
probe exactly as it shipped, three of four deliberately broken controls reported
`HOLDS`. Every `HOLDS` that probe had ever printed was uninformative.

This file turns it on everything else.

WHAT A ROW MEANS. For each instrument the registry declares up to three
demonstrations, each of which is RE-RUNNABLE and each of which STAGES ITS OWN
TREE in a temporary directory, so nothing here edits the repository:

    failing      the thing the instrument watches is GENUINELY BROKEN, and the
                 instrument must report it. Not a test that the instrument
                 runs; a demonstration that it goes red.
    passing      the same instrument on an unbroken subject, which must stay
                 green. S2 asks for both, and an instrument that reported
                 everything broken would be as useless as one that reported
                 everything fine.
    blind_spot   a genuine break the instrument demonstrably does NOT report.
                 This slot exists because R2 says a control that cannot fail is
                 reported, never patched into looking fine -- and because the
                 count of things our instruments cannot see is the honest
                 product of this ticket.

WHERE A SLOT IS ABSENT the registry must say why in `no_failing_demonstration`
or `no_passing_demonstration`, and the reason is printed in the table. THE COUNT
OF INSTRUMENTS WITH NO DEMONSTRATED FAILING INPUT IS THIS COMMAND'S PRODUCT. A
high count is the honest outcome. There is no target on the ratio; setting one
before anything had ever been demonstrated would be inventing the answer.

THIS IS NOT A GATE. It refuses nothing about the repository's design and no
close path consults it. It exits non-zero for exactly one reason: a DECLARED
demonstration did not reproduce -- which means either the instrument changed or
the demonstration went stale, and both are things a reader must be told rather
than left to discover.

SM-03: THE EXECUTABLE COUNT, AND WHY IT IS NOT OPTIONAL
-------------------------------------------------------

Every pytest demonstration in this file used to be judged on `expect_exit = 0`
and nothing else, and `FI-06` called those twelve slots hollow on the ground
that *"pytest returns 0 for a passing run and a fully skipped one"*. `SM-01`
seeded both skip shapes and measured the sentence:

    pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip(...)          items COLLECTED then skipped,
                                                pytest exits 0, slot says `ok`
    pytest.skip(..., allow_module_level=True)   NOTHING collected, pytest exits
                                                5, slot goes red

So the hole is **not** a demonstration that DISAPPEARS -- that one is already
caught. It is a demonstration that goes **VACUOUS**: still there, still
collected, still exit 0, asserting nothing. `SM-GM-I1` is that mutant and it
survived the registry unchanged.

The repair is the same one `SM-01-DF-01` asked for one layer down, where the
port-swap driver's suite columns carry no executable count and are therefore
structurally exempt from control checking: **a slot that cannot say how many
tests it ran cannot say that anything ran.** Every pytest slot now declares

    expect_passed             an EXACT count -- the slot cites node ids, so the
                              number is the number of nodes and does not drift
    expect_passed_at_least    a FLOOR -- the slot cites a whole file on purpose,
                              so an exact count would break every time a test is
                              added to it, which is a demonstration going stale
                              for a reason that has nothing to do with the
                              instrument

and `expect_skipped` defaults to **0** for every pytest slot, declared or not. A
skip inside a demonstration is a demonstration that did not happen. Both counts
are read out of pytest's own summary line, so they are the subprocess's report
of what it executed rather than this file's belief about it.

`tests/test_instrument_demonstrations.py::test_every_pytest_slot_declares_an_executable_count`
makes the declaration mandatory, so a new slot cannot arrive uncounted.

SM-03: STAGE-AWARE PYTEST
-------------------------

`run_pytest` used to run at `REPO_ROOT` unconditionally. Four rows were
classified `no-demonstration-constructible` with the reason *"not without
breaking a shipped file"* -- and `SM-01` (`SM-GM-I4`) showed that reason is a
fact about THIS RUNNER, not about those instruments: break the shipped file in a
throwaway tree and the tripwire goes red in 23 executed tests. So a pytest slot
that declares `stage` is now staged exactly like a `cli` slot and run inside the
staged tree, and those rows get real failing demonstrations instead of an
excuse.

#
# `test_the_named_instruments_are_all_enumerated` asserted `required <=
# enumerated` against a literal set of thirteen paths. That relation is
# ONE-DIRECTIONAL: a new instrument is not in `required`, so the subset stays
# true whether or not anyone registered it. It catches a RENAME and it cannot
# catch an OMISSION, its own docstring conceded so, and `FI-04-DF-04` was
# confirmed four times -- including by FI-04 itself, which shipped
# `run_arm_swap.py` in the same reconcile as the finding.
#
# The obvious repair is to add the missing paths to `required`. That is the
# shape rejected at `EVAL-RERUN-DF-01` and again at `ARM_MODULE_PREFIXES`: a
# literal that must be edited by the same person who forgot to register the
# instrument is not a check, it is a second thing to forget.
#
# So the set is DERIVED FROM THE TREE instead. `roots` declares WHERE the
# obligation applies -- a scope, one line, whose MEMBERS are discovered -- and
# every discovered candidate must appear in some row's `paths`. A new
# executable under a declared root is unregistered the moment it lands, and
# nothing anyone forgets to edit can make it register itself.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated rather than left for the next sweep to find:
# the predicate is a `__main__` guard plus a nonzero exit path, so a repo
# tripwire that is a pytest FILE (`tests/test_code_complexity.py`,

# rows are added by hand and this check does not pretend otherwise.
